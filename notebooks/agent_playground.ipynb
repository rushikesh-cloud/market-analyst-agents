Those sales were up 263% year over year, reflecting strong adoption of the company\\'s NVLink networking technology, as well as its Spectrum-X Ethernet switches with new deals from giants like Meta.\\n\\nNvidia\\'s gaming unit, which used to be its biggest, recorded revenue growth of 47% from a year ago to $3.7 billion, but fell 13% from the previous quarter. Analysts have speculated that Nvidia may skip the launch of a new gaming GPU this year, as memory constraints force chipmakers to prioritize AI processors. For Nvidia, that means AI accelerators largely sold in rack-scale systems like the 72-GPU Grace Blackwell.', 'score': 0.85567063, 'raw_content': None}, {'url': 'https://www.stocktitan.net/news/NVDA/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-j0kg9vc0geqr.html', 'title': 'NVIDIA Announces Financial Results for Fourth Quarter and Fiscal ...', 'content': 'SANTA CLARA, Calif., Feb. 25, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today reported record revenue for the fourth quarter ended January 25, 2026, of $68.1 billion, up 20% from the previous quarter and up 73% from a year ago.

Significant\\nannouncements during fiscal year 2025 included the following:  \\nFirst Quarter 2025:  \\n· MacBook Pro  \\n· Mac mini  \\n· iMac  \\n· iPad mini  \\nSecond Quarter 2025:  \\n· iPhone 16e  \\n· iPad Air  \\n· iPad  \\n· MacBook Air  \\n· Mac Studio  \\nThird Quarter 2025:  \\n· iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, iPadOS 26, watchOS 26, visionOS 26 and tvOS 26  \\n##### Fourth Quarter 2025:  \\n. iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max  \\n. Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3 and Apple Watch Ultra 3  \\n· AirPods Pro 3  \\n##### Fiscal Period  \\nThe Company\\'s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is\\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\\'s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which\\noccurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company\\'s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year\\n2023 spanned 53 weeks.  \\n##### Macroeconomic Conditions  \\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and\\ncould in the future materially impact, the Company\\'s results of operations and financial condition.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 21\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### Tariffs and Other Measures  \\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2025, new U.S. Tariffs were announced, including additional tariffs on imports from China,\\nIndia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the EU, among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or\\nthreatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S.\\nTariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs\\nor other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the\\nTrade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing\\nequipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other\\nmeasures that are applied to the Company\\'s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company\\'s supply chain, the\\navailability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains\\nuncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are\\nannounced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the\\noverall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the\\noverall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment\\nfor the Company\\'s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company\\'s business and results of\\noperations.  \\n##### Segment Operating Performance  \\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2025, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Americas</td>\\n<td>$ 178,353</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>$ 167,045</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>$ 162,560</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Europe</td>\\n<td>111,032</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>101,328</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>94,294</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Greater China</td>\\n<td>64,377</td>\\n<td>(4)%</td>\\n<td>66,952</td>\\n<td>(8)%</td>\\n<td>72,559</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Japan</td>\\n<td>28,703</td>\\n<td>15 %</td>\\n<td>25,052</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>24,257</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Rest of Asia Pacific</td>\\n<td>33,696</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>30,658</td>\\n<td>4 %</td>\\n<td>29,615</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>6 %</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>2 %</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n###### Americas  \\nAmericas net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

Significant\\nannouncements during fiscal year 2025 included the following:  \\nFirst Quarter 2025:  \\n· MacBook Pro  \\n· Mac mini  \\n· iMac  \\n· iPad mini  \\nSecond Quarter 2025:  \\n· iPhone 16e  \\n· iPad Air  \\n· iPad  \\n· MacBook Air  \\n· Mac Studio  \\nThird Quarter 2025:  \\n· iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, iPadOS 26, watchOS 26, visionOS 26 and tvOS 26  \\n##### Fourth Quarter 2025:  \\n. iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max  \\n. Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3 and Apple Watch Ultra 3  \\n· AirPods Pro 3  \\n##### Fiscal Period  \\nThe Company\\'s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is\\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\\'s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which\\noccurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company\\'s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year\\n2023 spanned 53 weeks.  \\n##### Macroeconomic Conditions  \\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and\\ncould in the future materially impact, the Company\\'s results of operations and financial condition.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 21\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### Tariffs and Other Measures  \\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2025, new U.S. Tariffs were announced, including additional tariffs on imports from China,\\nIndia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the EU, among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or\\nthreatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S.\\nTariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs\\nor other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the\\nTrade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing\\nequipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other\\nmeasures that are applied to the Company\\'s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company\\'s supply chain, the\\navailability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains\\nuncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are\\nannounced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the\\noverall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the\\noverall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment\\nfor the Company\\'s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company\\'s business and results of\\noperations.  \\n##### Segment Operating Performance  \\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2025, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Americas</td>\\n<td>$ 178,353</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>$ 167,045</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>$ 162,560</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Europe</td>\\n<td>111,032</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>101,328</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>94,294</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Greater China</td>\\n<td>64,377</td>\\n<td>(4)%</td>\\n<td>66,952</td>\\n<td>(8)%</td>\\n<td>72,559</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Japan</td>\\n<td>28,703</td>\\n<td>15 %</td>\\n<td>25,052</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>24,257</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Rest of Asia Pacific</td>\\n<td>33,696</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>30,658</td>\\n<td>4 %</td>\\n<td>29,615</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>6 %</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>2 %</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n###### Americas  \\nAmericas net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

Significant\\nannouncements during fiscal year 2025 included the following:  \\nFirst Quarter 2025:  \\n· MacBook Pro  \\n· Mac mini  \\n· iMac  \\n· iPad mini  \\nSecond Quarter 2025:  \\n· iPhone 16e  \\n· iPad Air  \\n· iPad  \\n· MacBook Air  \\n· Mac Studio  \\nThird Quarter 2025:  \\n· iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, iPadOS 26, watchOS 26, visionOS 26 and tvOS 26  \\n##### Fourth Quarter 2025:  \\n. iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max  \\n. Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3 and Apple Watch Ultra 3  \\n· AirPods Pro 3  \\n##### Fiscal Period  \\nThe Company\\'s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is\\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\\'s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which\\noccurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company\\'s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year\\n2023 spanned 53 weeks.  \\n##### Macroeconomic Conditions  \\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and\\ncould in the future materially impact, the Company\\'s results of operations and financial condition.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 21\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### Tariffs and Other Measures  \\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2025, new U.S. Tariffs were announced, including additional tariffs on imports from China,\\nIndia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the EU, among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or\\nthreatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S.\\nTariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs\\nor other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the\\nTrade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing\\nequipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other\\nmeasures that are applied to the Company\\'s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company\\'s supply chain, the\\navailability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains\\nuncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are\\nannounced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the\\noverall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the\\noverall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment\\nfor the Company\\'s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company\\'s business and results of\\noperations.  \\n##### Segment Operating Performance  \\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2025, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Americas</td>\\n<td>$ 178,353</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>$ 167,045</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>$ 162,560</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Europe</td>\\n<td>111,032</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>101,328</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>94,294</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Greater China</td>\\n<td>64,377</td>\\n<td>(4)%</td>\\n<td>66,952</td>\\n<td>(8)%</td>\\n<td>72,559</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Japan</td>\\n<td>28,703</td>\\n<td>15 %</td>\\n<td>25,052</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>24,257</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Rest of Asia Pacific</td>\\n<td>33,696</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>30,658</td>\\n<td>4 %</td>\\n<td>29,615</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>6 %</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>2 %</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n###### Americas  \\nAmericas net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

In response, several countries have imposed, or\\nthreatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S.\\nTariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs\\nor other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the\\nTrade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing\\nequipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other\\nmeasures that are applied to the Company\\'s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company\\'s supply chain, the\\navailability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains\\nuncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are\\nannounced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the\\noverall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the\\noverall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment\\nfor the Company\\'s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company\\'s business and results of\\noperations.  \\n##### Segment Operating Performance  \\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2025, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Americas</td>\\n<td>$ 178,353</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>$ 167,045</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>$ 162,560</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Europe</td>\\n<td>111,032</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>101,328</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>94,294</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Greater China</td>\\n<td>64,377</td>\\n<td>(4)%</td>\\n<td>66,952</td>\\n<td>(8)%</td>\\n<td>72,559</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Japan</td>\\n<td>28,703</td>\\n<td>15 %</td>\\n<td>25,052</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>24,257</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Rest of Asia Pacific</td>\\n<td>33,696</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>30,658</td>\\n<td>4 %</td>\\n<td>29,615</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>6 %</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>2 %</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n###### Americas  \\nAmericas net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the\\nsignificant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company\\'s\\nProducts net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company\\'s Services net sales, control transfers over\\ntime as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer\\nof control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.  \\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer\\nincentive programs based on the Company\\'s expectations and historical experience.  \\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the\\nCompany allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\"SSPs\").\\nWhen available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are\\nestablished that reflect the Company\\'s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they\\nwere sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\\'s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers\\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation\\nincluding, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings,\\nproduct-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.  \\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac\\nand iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the\\nhardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive\\ncertain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any\\nrelated discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable\\nprices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\\'s estimated SSPs. Revenue\\nallocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which\\ngenerally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized\\non a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.  \\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For\\nthese arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that\\nany unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized\\nrevenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.  \\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the\\nCompany recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when\\ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product,\\nretains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party\\napplications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the\\ncustomer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application-related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services\\nnet sales only the commission it retains.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 35\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe following table shows disaggregated net sales, as well as the portion of total net sales that was previously deferred, for\\n2025, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>iPhone</td>\\n<td>$ 209,586</td>\\n<td>$ 201,183</td>\\n<td>$ 200,583</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Mac</td>\\n<td>33,708</td>\\n<td>29,984</td>\\n<td>29,357</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>iPad</td>\\n<td>28,023</td>\\n<td>26,694</td>\\n<td>28,300</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Wearables, Home and Accessories</td>\\n<td>35,686</td>\\n<td>37,005</td>\\n<td>39,845</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Services (1)</td>\\n<td>109,158</td>\\n<td>96,169</td>\\n<td>85,200</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Portion of total net sales that was included in deferred revenue as of the beginning of the period</td>\\n<td>$ 8,229</td>\\n<td>$ 7,728</td>\\n<td>$ 8,169</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n(1) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.  \\nThe Company\\'s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment\\nin Note 13, \"Segment Information and Geographic Data\" for 2025, 2024 and 2023, except in Greater China, where iPhone\\nrevenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.  \\nAs of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the Company had total deferred revenue of $13.7 billion and $12.8 billion,\\nrespectively.

service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant\\nannouncements during fiscal year 2025 included the following:  \\nFirst Quarter 2025:  \\n· MacBook Pro  \\n· Mac mini  \\n· iMac  \\n· iPad mini  \\nSecond Quarter 2025:  \\n· iPhone 16e  \\n· iPad Air  \\n· iPad  \\n· MacBook Air  \\n· Mac Studio  \\nThird Quarter 2025:  \\n· iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, iPadOS 26, watchOS 26, visionOS 26 and tvOS 26  \\n##### Fourth Quarter 2025:  \\n. iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max  \\n. Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3 and Apple Watch Ultra 3  \\n· AirPods Pro 3  \\n##### Fiscal Period  \\nThe Company\\'s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is\\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\\'s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which\\noccurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company\\'s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year\\n2023 spanned 53 weeks.  \\n##### Macroeconomic Conditions  \\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and\\ncould in the future materially impact, the Company\\'s results of operations and financial condition.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 21\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### Tariffs and Other Measures  \\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2025, new U.S. Tariffs were announced, including additional tariffs on imports from China,\\nIndia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the EU, among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or\\nthreatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S.\\nTariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs\\nor other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the\\nTrade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing\\nequipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other\\nmeasures that are applied to the Company\\'s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company\\'s supply chain, the\\navailability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains\\nuncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are\\nannounced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the\\noverall magnitude and duration of these measures.

Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the\\nsignificant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company\\'s\\nProducts net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company\\'s Services net sales, control transfers over\\ntime as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer\\nof control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.  \\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer\\nincentive programs based on the Company\\'s expectations and historical experience.  \\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the\\nCompany allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\"SSPs\").\\nWhen available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are\\nestablished that reflect the Company\\'s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they\\nwere sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\\'s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers\\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation\\nincluding, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings,\\nproduct-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.  \\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac\\nand iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the\\nhardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive\\ncertain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any\\nrelated discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable\\nprices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\\'s estimated SSPs. Revenue\\nallocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which\\ngenerally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized\\non a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.  \\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For\\nthese arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that\\nany unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized\\nrevenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.  \\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the\\nCompany recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when\\ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product,\\nretains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party\\napplications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the\\ncustomer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application-related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services\\nnet sales only the commission it retains.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 35\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe following table shows disaggregated net sales, as well as the portion of total net sales that was previously deferred, for\\n2025, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>iPhone</td>\\n<td>$ 209,586</td>\\n<td>$ 201,183</td>\\n<td>$ 200,583</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Mac</td>\\n<td>33,708</td>\\n<td>29,984</td>\\n<td>29,357</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>iPad</td>\\n<td>28,023</td>\\n<td>26,694</td>\\n<td>28,300</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Wearables, Home and Accessories</td>\\n<td>35,686</td>\\n<td>37,005</td>\\n<td>39,845</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Services (1)</td>\\n<td>109,158</td>\\n<td>96,169</td>\\n<td>85,200</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Portion of total net sales that was included in deferred revenue as of the beginning of the period</td>\\n<td>$ 8,229</td>\\n<td>$ 7,728</td>\\n<td>$ 8,169</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n(1) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.  \\nThe Company\\'s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment\\nin Note 13, \"Segment Information and Geographic Data\" for 2025, 2024 and 2023, except in Greater China, where iPhone\\nrevenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.  \\nAs of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the Company had total deferred revenue of $13.7 billion and $12.8 billion,\\nrespectively.

Significant\\nannouncements during fiscal year 2025 included the following:  \\nFirst Quarter 2025:  \\n· MacBook Pro  \\n· Mac mini  \\n· iMac  \\n· iPad mini  \\nSecond Quarter 2025:  \\n· iPhone 16e  \\n· iPad Air  \\n· iPad  \\n· MacBook Air  \\n· Mac Studio  \\nThird Quarter 2025:  \\n· iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, iPadOS 26, watchOS 26, visionOS 26 and tvOS 26  \\n##### Fourth Quarter 2025:  \\n. iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max  \\n. Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3 and Apple Watch Ultra 3  \\n· AirPods Pro 3  \\n##### Fiscal Period  \\nThe Company\\'s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is\\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\\'s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which\\noccurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company\\'s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year\\n2023 spanned 53 weeks.  \\n##### Macroeconomic Conditions  \\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and\\ncould in the future materially impact, the Company\\'s results of operations and financial condition.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 21\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### Tariffs and Other Measures  \\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2025, new U.S. Tariffs were announced, including additional tariffs on imports from China,\\nIndia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the EU, among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or\\nthreatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S.\\nTariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs\\nor other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the\\nTrade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing\\nequipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other\\nmeasures that are applied to the Company\\'s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company\\'s supply chain, the\\navailability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains\\nuncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are\\nannounced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the\\noverall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the\\noverall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment\\nfor the Company\\'s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company\\'s business and results of\\noperations.  \\n##### Segment Operating Performance  \\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2025, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Americas</td>\\n<td>$ 178,353</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>$ 167,045</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>$ 162,560</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Europe</td>\\n<td>111,032</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>101,328</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>94,294</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Greater China</td>\\n<td>64,377</td>\\n<td>(4)%</td>\\n<td>66,952</td>\\n<td>(8)%</td>\\n<td>72,559</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Japan</td>\\n<td>28,703</td>\\n<td>15 %</td>\\n<td>25,052</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>24,257</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Rest of Asia Pacific</td>\\n<td>33,696</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>30,658</td>\\n<td>4 %</td>\\n<td>29,615</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>6 %</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>2 %</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n###### Americas  \\nAmericas net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

Company\\'s\\nmanagement to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, \"Summary of Significant\\nAccounting Policies\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the\\nsignificant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements.\\nManagement bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under\\nthe circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.  \\n##### Uncertain Tax Positions  \\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company\\'s\\nuncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and\\ninternational tax laws, including the TCJA and the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although\\nmanagement believes the Company\\'s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these\\nuncertainties will not be different from that reflected in the Company\\'s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing\\nfacts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination.

Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the\\nsignificant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company\\'s\\nProducts net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company\\'s Services net sales, control transfers over\\ntime as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer\\nof control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.  \\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer\\nincentive programs based on the Company\\'s expectations and historical experience.  \\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the\\nCompany allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\"SSPs\").\\nWhen available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are\\nestablished that reflect the Company\\'s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they\\nwere sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\\'s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers\\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation\\nincluding, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings,\\nproduct-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.  \\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac\\nand iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the\\nhardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive\\ncertain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any\\nrelated discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable\\nprices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\\'s estimated SSPs. Revenue\\nallocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which\\ngenerally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized\\non a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.  \\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For\\nthese arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that\\nany unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized\\nrevenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.  \\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the\\nCompany recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when\\ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product,\\nretains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party\\napplications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the\\ncustomer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application-related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services\\nnet sales only the commission it retains.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 35\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe following table shows disaggregated net sales, as well as the portion of total net sales that was previously deferred, for\\n2025, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>iPhone</td>\\n<td>$ 209,586</td>\\n<td>$ 201,183</td>\\n<td>$ 200,583</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Mac</td>\\n<td>33,708</td>\\n<td>29,984</td>\\n<td>29,357</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>iPad</td>\\n<td>28,023</td>\\n<td>26,694</td>\\n<td>28,300</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Wearables, Home and Accessories</td>\\n<td>35,686</td>\\n<td>37,005</td>\\n<td>39,845</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Services (1)</td>\\n<td>109,158</td>\\n<td>96,169</td>\\n<td>85,200</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Portion of total net sales that was included in deferred revenue as of the beginning of the period</td>\\n<td>$ 8,229</td>\\n<td>$ 7,728</td>\\n<td>$ 8,169</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n(1) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.  \\nThe Company\\'s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment\\nin Note 13, \"Segment Information and Geographic Data\" for 2025, 2024 and 2023, except in Greater China, where iPhone\\nrevenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.  \\nAs of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the Company had total deferred revenue of $13.7 billion and $12.8 billion,\\nrespectively.

The Company\\'s net sales and gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a\\nvariety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the\\nCompany may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\\'s ability to effectively stimulate demand\\nfor certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of\\ncomponents, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company\\'s services; the\\nCompany\\'s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the\\ngeographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product\\nand service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; the imposition of new\\nor increased tariffs and other trade restrictions, their overall magnitude and duration, and retaliatory actions in response; and the\\nintroduction of new products or services, including new products or services with lower profit margins. These and other factors\\ncould have a materially adverse impact on the Company\\'s results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Further, the\\nCompany generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product category and a decline in demand for that product\\ncould significantly impact net sales and gross margins.  \\n##### The Company\\'s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.  \\nThe Company\\'s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales, cost\\nof sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company\\'s products in foreign countries and on products that\\ninclude components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be\\nmaterially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.  \\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\\'s foreign\\ncurrency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing\\ndemand for the Company\\'s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to\\nraise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\\'s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross\\nmargins the Company earns on foreign currency-denominated sales.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 15\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\\'s foreign\\ncurrency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its\\nforeign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may\\nincrease the Company\\'s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.  \\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to\\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a\\nportion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are\\nin place.  \\n##### The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.  \\nThe Company\\'s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and\\neconomic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of\\nthe Company\\'s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Although the Company has not\\nrealized significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in\\nsignificant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\\'s results of operations, financial condition and stock\\nprice.  \\n##### The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.  \\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers and other resellers.\\nThe Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and\\ngovernment customers. A substantial majority of the Company\\'s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral,\\nthird-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company\\'s trade\\nreceivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company\\'s exposure to credit and\\ncollectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-\\ntrade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture\\nsubassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with\\nlong-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 27, 2025, the Company\\'s vendor non-\\ntrade receivables were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. If the Company is unable to\\nmonitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, the\\nCompany\\'s results of operations, financial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.  \\n##### The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.  \\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a\\nnumber of the Company\\'s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income\\ntaxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for\\nEconomic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the\\nintroduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company\\'s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings\\nin countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of\\nnew taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant\\njudgment and be subject to differing interpretations.  \\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service\\nand other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome\\nresulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. The outcome of such examinations is\\ninherently uncertain. If the Company\\'s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\\'s\\ntaxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\\'s business, results of operations, financial\\ncondition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 16\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->', name='company_retriever', id='ecc9b264-17bb-407f-8512-435b85c6330b', tool_call_id='call_YleJzMpeubLdIlW6DJPuddnd'), ToolMessage(content='[1] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n#### Financial Risks  \\n##### The Company\\'s net sales and gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors.  \\nThe Company\\'s gross margins vary significantly across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels\\nand can change over time.

Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and\\ninsolvency.  \\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\\'s trade receivables; the\\nfailure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company\\'s ability to issue new debt; reduced\\nliquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company\\'s financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially\\nadversely affect the Company\\'s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 5\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe Company\\'s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical\\ntensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business\\ninterruptions.  \\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health\\nissues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can have a material adverse effect on the Company and its\\ncustomers, employees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other\\nchannel partners.  \\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\\'s total net sales,\\nand the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. A significant majority of the Company\\'s\\nmanufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South\\nKorea, Taiwan and Vietnam, in addition to sourcing from partners and facilities located in the U.S. Restrictions on international\\ntrade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the\\nCompany\\'s business and supply chain. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries\\nand regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations.\\nRestrictive measures can increase the cost or limit the availability of the Company\\'s products and the components and rare\\nearths and other raw materials that go into them. Restrictive measures can also require the Company to change suppliers,\\nrestructure business relationships and operations, refrain from offering and distributing or cease to offer and distribute affected\\nproducts, services and third-party applications to its customers, and increase the prices of its products and services. Changing\\nthe Company\\'s business and supply chain in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be\\nexpensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\\'s business and results of operations. Trade and other international\\ndisputes can also have an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in\\nconsumer spending and negative consumer sentiment for the Company\\'s products and services, all of which can further\\nadversely affect the Company\\'s business and results of operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance\\nnotice, which can create uncertainty, and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate any or all adverse impacts from\\nsuch measures. Global supply chains can be highly concentrated, and an escalation of geopolitical tensions or conflict could\\nresult in significant disruptions. Beginning in the second quarter of 2025, new tariffs were announced on imports to the U.S.\\n(\"U.S. Tariffs\"), including additional tariffs on imports from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the European\\nUnion (\"EU\"), among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or threatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports\\nfrom the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S. Tariffs have been announced and further\\nchanges could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs or other measures. For example, the U.S.\\nDepartment of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended,\\ninto, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products,\\nincluding downstream products that contain semiconductors. The ultimate impact remains uncertain and will depend on several\\nfactors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to what extent\\nother countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the overall magnitude and duration of these\\nmeasures. If disputes and conflicts further escalate, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and\\nrestrictive.  \\nMany of the Company\\'s operations, retail stores and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\\'s suppliers\\nand contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change is\\nresulting in certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. In\\naddition, the Company\\'s and its suppliers\\' operations, retail stores and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire,\\npower shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts,\\nransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company\\'s\\ncontrol.  \\nSuch events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create\\ndelays and inefficiencies in the Company\\'s supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\\'s\\nservice offerings, increase the Company\\'s costs, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas.  \\nThe Company\\'s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While\\nthe Company\\'s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur\\nand could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company\\'s business, and harm to the Company\\'s reputation.\\nMajor public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the\\nfuture materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products;\\nthe imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight\\nservices and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company\\'s operations, supply chain and sales\\nand distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays\\nin production ramps of new products and development of new services.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 6\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nFollowing any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, incur significant expenditures to\\nresume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and\\nmanufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative\\nconsequences to the Company. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance\\ncoverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. Any of the foregoing can materially adversely affect the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\n##### Global markets for the Company\\'s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.  \\nThe Company\\'s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets. These markets are characterized by\\naggressive price competition, downward pressure on gross margins, continual improvement in product performance, and price\\nsensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. These markets are further defined by frequent introduction of new products\\nand services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, and rapid adoption of technological advancements.  \\nThe Company\\'s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative\\nnew products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for\\nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the\\nCompany must make significant investments in R&D. These investments may not achieve expected returns, and the Company\\nmay not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.  \\nThe Company\\'s ability to compete successfully also depends on the effective protection and enforcement of its intellectual\\nproperty rights. Regulatory requirements, government investigations and litigation can force the Company to withdraw from, or\\nmodify its products and services for, certain countries and limit its ability to derive value from, or to enjoin others from using, its\\nintellectual property rights. Additionally, they may require the Company to share its innovations with competitors. Any of these\\noutcomes can have a negative impact on the Company\\'s competitive advantage and materially adversely affect its business,\\nresults of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to\\nregister, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company\\'s competitors seek to compete\\nprimarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\\'s products and infringing on\\nits intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the\\nCompany operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if\\ncompetitors infringe on the Company\\'s intellectual property, the Company\\'s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be\\nmaterially adversely affected.  \\nThe Company\\'s products and services face substantial competition from companies that have significant technical, marketing,\\ndistribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and service offerings. In addition, the Company faces\\nsignificant competition as competitors imitate the Company\\'s product features and applications within their products to offer more\\ncompetitive solutions. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company\\'s approach to\\nproviding components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. Some of the\\nCompany\\'s competitors have broad product lines, low-priced products, large installed bases of active devices, and large\\ncustomer bases. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product\\nmargins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products and services at little or no\\nprofit or even at a loss. The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer, tablet and\\nwearables markets, and some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no\\ngrowth or contracted overall.  \\nIf the Company is unable to compete successfully, its business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock\\nprice can be materially adversely affected.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 7\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n[3] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n#### Competition  \\nThe markets for the Company\\'s products and services are highly competitive and are characterized by aggressive price\\ncompetition, downward pressure on gross margins, continual improvement in product performance, and price sensitivity on the\\npart of consumers and businesses.

The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for\\nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal\\ncompetitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative\\nprice and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design and technology innovation, a strong third-party software\\nand accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, corporate reputation, and the ability to\\neffectively protect and enforce the Company\\'s intellectual property rights.  \\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables\\nand accessories, and services. The Company\\'s products and services face substantial competition from companies that have\\nsignificant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings\\nwith large customer bases. In addition, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\\'s product\\nfeatures and applications within their products to offer more competitive solutions.

The Company has a minority market share in the global\\nsmartphone, personal computer, tablet and wearables markets, and some of the markets in which the Company competes have\\nfrom time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.  \\n##### Supply of Components  \\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\\'s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with\\nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many\\ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide\\nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. Restrictions on international trade can increase the cost or limit the\\navailability of the Company\\'s products and the components and rare earths and other raw materials that go into them.  \\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by\\nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\\' yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have\\nincreased. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, the Company may not be\\nable to extend or renew agreements for the supply of components on similar terms, or at all, and may not be successful in\\nobtaining sufficient quantities from its suppliers or in a timely manner, or in identifying and obtaining sufficient quantities from an\\nalternative source. In addition, component suppliers may fail, be subject to consolidation within a particular industry, or decide to\\nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\\'s requirements,\\nfurther limiting the Company\\'s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\\n\\n[4] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n#### Product, Service and Software Announcements  \\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant\\nannouncements during fiscal year 2025 included the following:  \\nFirst Quarter 2025:  \\n· MacBook Pro  \\n· Mac mini  \\n· iMac  \\n· iPad mini  \\nSecond Quarter 2025:  \\n· iPhone 16e  \\n· iPad Air  \\n· iPad  \\n· MacBook Air  \\n· Mac Studio  \\nThird Quarter 2025:  \\n· iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, iPadOS 26, watchOS 26, visionOS 26 and tvOS 26  \\n##### Fourth Quarter 2025:  \\n. iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max  \\n. Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3 and Apple Watch Ultra 3  \\n· AirPods Pro 3  \\n##### Fiscal Period  \\nThe Company\\'s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is\\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\\'s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which\\noccurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company\\'s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year\\n2023 spanned 53 weeks.  \\n##### Macroeconomic Conditions  \\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and\\ncould in the future materially impact, the Company\\'s results of operations and financial condition.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 21\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### Tariffs and Other Measures  \\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2025, new U.S. Tariffs were announced, including additional tariffs on imports from China,\\nIndia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the EU, among others.

Many of the forward-looking statements are\\nlocated in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading \"Business\" and Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the heading\\n\"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" Forward-looking statements\\nprovide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly\\nrelate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-K regarding the potential future impact of\\nmacroeconomic conditions and tariffs and other measures on the Company\\'s business and results of operations are forward-\\nlooking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as \"future,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\"\\n\"estimates,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"predicts,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"could,\" \"can,\" \"may,\" and similar terms. Forward-\\nlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company\\'s actual results may differ significantly from the\\nresults discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to,\\nthose discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading \"Risk Factors.\" The Company assumes no obligation to\\nrevise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.  \\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company\\'s fiscal calendar, and references to\\nparticular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company\\'s fiscal years ended in September and the associated\\nquarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the \"Company\" and \"Apple\" as used herein refers\\ncollectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.\\n\\n[7] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n#### Critical Accounting Estimates  \\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\\n(\"GAAP\") and the Company\\'s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\\'s\\nmanagement to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, \"Summary of Significant\\nAccounting Policies\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the\\nsignificant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements.\\nManagement bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under\\nthe circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.  \\n##### Uncertain Tax Positions  \\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company\\'s\\nuncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and\\ninternational tax laws, including the TCJA and the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although\\nmanagement believes the Company\\'s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these\\nuncertainties will not be different from that reflected in the Company\\'s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing\\nfacts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent\\nwith management\\'s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\\'s financial condition and operating results.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 26\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### Legal and Other Contingencies  \\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of\\nwhich are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount is\\nreasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner\\ninconsistent with management\\'s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\\'s financial condition and operating\\nresults.\\n\\n[8] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n#### Business Risks  \\n##### To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.  \\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company\\nmust continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively\\nstimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, navigate global regulatory requirements and barriers\\nto market access, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of\\nnew product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including the Company\\'s ability to recruit and retain\\nhighly skilled personnel to execute on its strategic initiatives, and the timely and successful development and market acceptance\\nof new products, services and technologies. Success also relies on the Company\\'s ability to manage the risks associated with\\nnew technologies and production ramp-up issues, the effective integration of third-party services and technologies into the\\nCompany\\'s products and services, the availability, delivery and performance of application software or other third-party support\\nfor the Company\\'s products and services, the effective management of manufacturing and other purchase commitments and the\\nmanagement of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, and the availability of products in appropriate quantities\\nand at expected costs to meet anticipated demand. Additionally, quality issues or other defects or deficiencies can adversely\\naffect the success of new product and service introductions and market acceptance. New products, services and technologies\\nmay replace or supersede existing offerings and may produce lower revenues and lower profit margins. The Company may not\\nbe able to successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services, which can materially adversely\\naffect the Company\\'s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\n###### The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.  \\nA significant majority of the Company\\'s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily\\nin China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, in addition to sourcing from partners and facilities located in\\nthe U.S. The Company relies on single-source partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many\\ncomponents, and on partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company\\'s hardware\\nproducts. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements\\ncan lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\\'s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished\\ncontrol has from time to time had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on the cost, quality or quantity of products\\nmanufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company\\'s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although\\narrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally\\nremains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences\\nunanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code\\nof conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company\\'s\\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\nChanges or additions to the Company\\'s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and\\nuncertainties, including exposure to additional regulatory and operational risks.  \\n####### Future operating results depend upon the Company\\'s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.  \\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant\\nsupply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to\\nindustry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company\\'s\\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the\\npast experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company\\'s ability to obtain sufficient\\nquantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future.  \\nAdditionally, the Company\\'s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component\\nor product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\\' yields have matured or their\\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The Company may not be able to extend or renew agreements for the supply of\\ncomponents on similar terms, or at all, and may not be successful in obtaining sufficient quantities from its suppliers in a timely\\nmanner, or in identifying and obtaining sufficient quantities from an alternative source. In addition, component suppliers may fail,\\nbe subject to consolidation within a particular industry, or decide to concentrate on the production of common components\\ninstead of components customized to meet the Company\\'s requirements, further limiting the Company\\'s ability to obtain sufficient\\nquantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant\\nrisks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial\\ncondition and stock price.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 8\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n###### The Company\\'s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business and result in harm to the Company\\'s reputation.  \\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing\\ndefects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues\\nthat can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist\\nin components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company\\'s\\nproducts unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the\\nCompany\\'s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company\\'s service offerings\\ncan have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the\\nCompany\\'s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. The introduction of new and\\ncomplex technologies, such as artificial intelligence features, can increase these and other safety risks, including exposing users\\nto harmful, inaccurate or other negative content and experiences. The Company may not be able to detect and fix all issues and\\ndefects in the hardware, software and services it offers, which can result in widespread technical and performance issues\\naffecting the Company\\'s products and services. Errors, bugs and vulnerabilities can be exploited by third parties, compromising\\nthe safety and security of a user\\'s device. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product\\nreplacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant\\nwarranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can adversely affect the\\nexperience for users of the Company\\'s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\\'s reputation, loss of\\ncompetitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service\\nintroductions and lost sales.  \\n##### The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.  \\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories if cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company\\nreviews other assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\\' facilities, inventory prepayments and other long-lived assets,\\nfor impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. Although the Company believes\\nits inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets are currently recoverable, the Company may incur write-\\ndowns, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which\\nthe Company competes.  \\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments.\\nManufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company\\'s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for\\nperiods up to 150 days. Because the Company\\'s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price\\nchanges, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components\\nor products, or not fully utilize purchase commitments. The Company accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of\\nexcess products and components.  \\n##### The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.  \\nThe Company\\'s products and services include technology or intellectual property that must be licensed from third parties. In\\naddition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may\\ncompete, current extensive intellectual property coverage and the rapid rate of new intellectual property rights generation, the\\nCompany\\'s products and services may be alleged to infringe existing intellectual property rights of others. This risk may be\\nexacerbated by the use of new and emerging technologies, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, which can\\ninvolve, among other things, the acquisition and use of copyrighted materials for training as well as the potential reproduction of\\ncopyrighted materials in their outputs. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain\\nintellectual property rights of third parties. The Company is not always able to obtain all necessary licenses to third-party\\nintellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual\\nproperty, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can require the Company to modify certain\\nproducts, services or features or preclude the Company from selling certain products or services and expose the Company to\\nsignificant licensing costs, all of which can materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, reputation, results of operations,\\nfinancial condition and stock price.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 9\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### The Company\\'s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.  \\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party\\nsoftware applications and services. Third-party developers may discontinue the development and maintenance of software\\napplications and services for the Company\\'s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed\\nand maintained for the Company\\'s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\\'s products, adversely impacting the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\nThe Company believes that third-party developer support depends on the perceived benefits of creating software and services\\nfor the Company\\'s products compared to competitors\\' platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for\\npersonal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on\\nfactors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected\\nfuture growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.  \\nThe Company\\'s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer, tablet and wearables markets can make\\ndevelopers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company\\'s products and more inclined to devote their resources\\nto developing and upgrading software for competitors\\' products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on\\nthese competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company\\'s devices can suffer.  \\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its\\nproducts. The Company\\'s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party\\ndevelopers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these\\nchanges to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower\\ncustomer demand for the Company\\'s products.  \\n###### Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company\\'s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition.  \\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or\\noffer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company\\'s own services.\\nThe licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the\\ncontinuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers\\nand distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or\\nimpossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may\\nseek to limit the Company\\'s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a\\nwide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.  \\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for\\ntalent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company\\'s customers.  \\n####### The Company\\'s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company\\'s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture.  \\nMuch of the Company\\'s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and\\nservice of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced\\npersonnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley,\\nwhere most of the Company\\'s key personnel are located. Periods of intense competition for talent in particular fields can lead to\\nincreased costs as the Company seeks to offer competitive compensation to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. In\\naddition to competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving and the Company must navigate changes\\neffectively in order to achieve its strategic initiatives. Laws and regulations, including immigration, labor and employment laws\\nand export controls, among others, can materially adversely affect the Company\\'s ability to recruit and retain a highly skilled,\\nglobal workforce. If the Company does not effectively manage changing workforce dynamics and regulatory requirements, it\\ncould materially adversely affect the Company\\'s culture, operational flexibility, strategy and costs, all of which can materially\\nadversely affect the Company\\'s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\nThe Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to\\nnurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company\\'s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who\\nare critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, reputation, results of\\noperations, financial condition and stock price.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 10\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### The Company depends on the performance of carriers and other resellers.  \\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers and other resellers, many of\\nwhich distribute products and services from competitors. Resellers offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for\\nusers\\' purchases of devices, and such plans may be discontinued or modified any time.  \\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected\\nresellers\\' stores with Company employees and contractors, improving product placement displays, and developing and making\\ndigital marketing assets available to resellers. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or\\nincremental sales. For example, the purchasing preferences and behaviors of consumers may change, the financial condition of\\nresellers could weaken, resellers could stop distributing the Company\\'s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or\\nall of the Company\\'s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company\\'s products, all of\\nwhich could materially adversely impact the Company\\'s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\n###### The Company\\'s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions.  \\nThe Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to\\ninformation technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions,\\ntelecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other\\ncybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be\\nineffective or inadequate, and the Company\\'s or its vendors\\' business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be\\nsufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company\\'s business by, among other things,\\npreventing access to the Company\\'s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and\\nshipping of the Company\\'s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, reputation, results\\nof operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\n###### Losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.  \\nThe Company\\'s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal and sensitive health and\\nfinancial information with respect to the Company\\'s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to\\nsystems and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems\\nand data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential\\ninformation occur and could materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, reputation, results of operations, financial\\ncondition and stock price.  \\nThe Company\\'s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company\\nrelies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations.\\nAlthough the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on\\nthe Company\\'s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential\\ninformation occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business,\\nreputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis.\\nThese attacks target the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information and may disrupt normal business\\noperations. Attacks can impair the Company\\'s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, affect its stock\\nprice, damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, potentially resulting\\nin penalties, fines or judgments. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with\\nincreasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or\\nobfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company\\'s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In\\naddition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of geopolitical tensions or conflict.  \\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many\\ncompanies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and\\nthe value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 11\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nAs with all companies, the security the Company has implemented may not be sufficient for all eventualities and are vulnerable\\nto hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities.\\nFor example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company\\'s or its suppliers\\' and other third parties\\' employees or\\ncustomers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized\\naccess to the Company\\'s or such suppliers\\' or third parties\\' systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company,\\nthe Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for\\nunusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or\\nloss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company\\'s products and services.  \\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such\\ninsurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.  \\n###### Investment in new business strategies, commercial relationships and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\\'s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated, and materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.  \\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies, commercial relationships and acquisitions.\\nSuch endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations,\\ngreater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in\\nnew businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and\\nsignificant write-offs.

Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3 and Apple Watch Ultra 3  \\n· AirPods Pro 3  \\n##### Fiscal Period  \\nThe Company\\'s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is\\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\\'s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which\\noccurred in the first quarter of 2023.

In response, several countries have imposed, or\\nthreatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S.\\nTariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs\\nor other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the\\nTrade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing\\nequipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other\\nmeasures that are applied to the Company\\'s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company\\'s supply chain, the\\navailability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains\\nuncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are\\nannounced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the\\noverall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the\\noverall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment\\nfor the Company\\'s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company\\'s business and results of\\noperations.  \\n##### Segment Operating Performance  \\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2025, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Americas</td>\\n<td>$ 178,353</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>$ 167,045</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>$ 162,560</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Europe</td>\\n<td>111,032</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>101,328</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>94,294</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Greater China</td>\\n<td>64,377</td>\\n<td>(4)%</td>\\n<td>66,952</td>\\n<td>(8)%</td>\\n<td>72,559</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Japan</td>\\n<td>28,703</td>\\n<td>15 %</td>\\n<td>25,052</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>24,257</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Rest of Asia Pacific</td>\\n<td>33,696</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>30,658</td>\\n<td>4 %</td>\\n<td>29,615</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>6 %</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>2 %</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n###### Americas  \\nAmericas net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

The Company\\'s net sales and gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a\\nvariety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the\\nCompany may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\\'s ability to effectively stimulate demand\\nfor certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of\\ncomponents, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company\\'s services; the\\nCompany\\'s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the\\ngeographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product\\nand service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; the imposition of new\\nor increased tariffs and other trade restrictions, their overall magnitude and duration, and retaliatory actions in response; and the\\nintroduction of new products or services, including new products or services with lower profit margins. These and other factors\\ncould have a materially adverse impact on the Company\\'s results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Further, the\\nCompany generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product category and a decline in demand for that product\\ncould significantly impact net sales and gross margins.  \\n##### The Company\\'s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.  \\nThe Company\\'s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales, cost\\nof sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company\\'s products in foreign countries and on products that\\ninclude components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be\\nmaterially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.  \\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\\'s foreign\\ncurrency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing\\ndemand for the Company\\'s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to\\nraise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\\'s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross\\nmargins the Company earns on foreign currency-denominated sales.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 15\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\\'s foreign\\ncurrency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its\\nforeign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may\\nincrease the Company\\'s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.  \\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to\\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a\\nportion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are\\nin place.  \\n##### The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.  \\nThe Company\\'s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and\\neconomic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of\\nthe Company\\'s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Although the Company has not\\nrealized significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in\\nsignificant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\\'s results of operations, financial condition and stock\\nprice.  \\n##### The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.  \\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers and other resellers.\\nThe Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and\\ngovernment customers. A substantial majority of the Company\\'s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral,\\nthird-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company\\'s trade\\nreceivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company\\'s exposure to credit and\\ncollectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-\\ntrade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture\\nsubassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with\\nlong-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 27, 2025, the Company\\'s vendor non-\\ntrade receivables were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. If the Company is unable to\\nmonitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, the\\nCompany\\'s results of operations, financial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.  \\n##### The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.  \\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a\\nnumber of the Company\\'s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income\\ntaxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for\\nEconomic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the\\nintroduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company\\'s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings\\nin countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of\\nnew taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant\\njudgment and be subject to differing interpretations.  \\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service\\nand other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome\\nresulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. The outcome of such examinations is\\ninherently uncertain. If the Company\\'s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\\'s\\ntaxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\\'s business, results of operations, financial\\ncondition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 16\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n[8] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n# Apple Inc.

Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3 and Apple Watch Ultra 3  \\n· AirPods Pro 3  \\n##### Fiscal Period  \\nThe Company\\'s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is\\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\\'s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which\\noccurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company\\'s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year\\n2023 spanned 53 weeks.  \\n##### Macroeconomic Conditions  \\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and\\ncould in the future materially impact, the Company\\'s results of operations and financial condition.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 21\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### Tariffs and Other Measures  \\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2025, new U.S. Tariffs were announced, including additional tariffs on imports from China,\\nIndia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the EU, among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or\\nthreatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S.\\nTariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs\\nor other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the\\nTrade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing\\nequipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other\\nmeasures that are applied to the Company\\'s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company\\'s supply chain, the\\navailability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains\\nuncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are\\nannounced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the\\noverall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the\\noverall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment\\nfor the Company\\'s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company\\'s business and results of\\noperations.  \\n##### Segment Operating Performance  \\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2025, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Americas</td>\\n<td>$ 178,353</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>$ 167,045</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>$ 162,560</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Europe</td>\\n<td>111,032</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>101,328</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>94,294</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Greater China</td>\\n<td>64,377</td>\\n<td>(4)%</td>\\n<td>66,952</td>\\n<td>(8)%</td>\\n<td>72,559</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Japan</td>\\n<td>28,703</td>\\n<td>15 %</td>\\n<td>25,052</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>24,257</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Rest of Asia Pacific</td>\\n<td>33,696</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>30,658</td>\\n<td>4 %</td>\\n<td>29,615</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>6 %</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>2 %</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n###### Americas  \\nAmericas net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

be entitled when control of products or services is\\ntransferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the\\nsignificant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company\\'s\\nProducts net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company\\'s Services net sales, control transfers over\\ntime as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer\\nof control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.  \\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer\\nincentive programs based on the Company\\'s expectations and historical experience.  \\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the\\nCompany allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\"SSPs\").\\nWhen available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are\\nestablished that reflect the Company\\'s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they\\nwere sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\\'s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers\\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation\\nincluding, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings,\\nproduct-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.  \\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac\\nand iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the\\nhardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive\\ncertain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any\\nrelated discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable\\nprices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\\'s estimated SSPs. Revenue\\nallocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which\\ngenerally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized\\non a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.  \\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For\\nthese arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that\\nany unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized\\nrevenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.  \\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the\\nCompany recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when\\ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product,\\nretains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party\\napplications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the\\ncustomer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application-related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services\\nnet sales only the commission it retains.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 35\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe following table shows disaggregated net sales, as well as the portion of total net sales that was previously deferred, for\\n2025, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>iPhone</td>\\n<td>$ 209,586</td>\\n<td>$ 201,183</td>\\n<td>$ 200,583</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Mac</td>\\n<td>33,708</td>\\n<td>29,984</td>\\n<td>29,357</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>iPad</td>\\n<td>28,023</td>\\n<td>26,694</td>\\n<td>28,300</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Wearables, Home and Accessories</td>\\n<td>35,686</td>\\n<td>37,005</td>\\n<td>39,845</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Services (1)</td>\\n<td>109,158</td>\\n<td>96,169</td>\\n<td>85,200</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Portion of total net sales that was included in deferred revenue as of the beginning of the period</td>\\n<td>$ 8,229</td>\\n<td>$ 7,728</td>\\n<td>$ 8,169</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n(1) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.  \\nThe Company\\'s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment\\nin Note 13, \"Segment Information and Geographic Data\" for 2025, 2024 and 2023, except in Greater China, where iPhone\\nrevenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.  \\nAs of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the Company had total deferred revenue of $13.7 billion and $12.8 billion,\\nrespectively.

Significant\\nannouncements during fiscal year 2025 included the following:  \\nFirst Quarter 2025:  \\n· MacBook Pro  \\n· Mac mini  \\n· iMac  \\n· iPad mini  \\nSecond Quarter 2025:  \\n· iPhone 16e  \\n· iPad Air  \\n· iPad  \\n· MacBook Air  \\n· Mac Studio  \\nThird Quarter 2025:  \\n· iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, iPadOS 26, watchOS 26, visionOS 26 and tvOS 26  \\n##### Fourth Quarter 2025:  \\n. iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max  \\n. Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3 and Apple Watch Ultra 3  \\n· AirPods Pro 3  \\n##### Fiscal Period  \\nThe Company\\'s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is\\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\\'s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which\\noccurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company\\'s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year\\n2023 spanned 53 weeks.  \\n##### Macroeconomic Conditions  \\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and\\ncould in the future materially impact, the Company\\'s results of operations and financial condition.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 21\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### Tariffs and Other Measures  \\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2025, new U.S. Tariffs were announced, including additional tariffs on imports from China,\\nIndia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the EU, among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or\\nthreatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S.\\nTariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs\\nor other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the\\nTrade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing\\nequipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other\\nmeasures that are applied to the Company\\'s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company\\'s supply chain, the\\navailability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains\\nuncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are\\nannounced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the\\noverall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the\\noverall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment\\nfor the Company\\'s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company\\'s business and results of\\noperations.  \\n##### Segment Operating Performance  \\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2025, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Americas</td>\\n<td>$ 178,353</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>$ 167,045</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>$ 162,560</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Europe</td>\\n<td>111,032</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>101,328</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>94,294</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Greater China</td>\\n<td>64,377</td>\\n<td>(4)%</td>\\n<td>66,952</td>\\n<td>(8)%</td>\\n<td>72,559</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Japan</td>\\n<td>28,703</td>\\n<td>15 %</td>\\n<td>25,052</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>24,257</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Rest of Asia Pacific</td>\\n<td>33,696</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>30,658</td>\\n<td>4 %</td>\\n<td>29,615</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>6 %</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>2 %</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n###### Americas  \\nAmericas net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

An additional week is\\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\\'s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which\\noccurred in the first quarter of 2023.

In response, several countries have imposed, or\\nthreatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S.\\nTariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs\\nor other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the\\nTrade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing\\nequipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other\\nmeasures that are applied to the Company\\'s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company\\'s supply chain, the\\navailability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains\\nuncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are\\nannounced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the\\noverall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the\\noverall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment\\nfor the Company\\'s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company\\'s business and results of\\noperations.  \\n##### Segment Operating Performance  \\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2025, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Americas</td>\\n<td>$ 178,353</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>$ 167,045</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>$ 162,560</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Europe</td>\\n<td>111,032</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>101,328</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>94,294</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Greater China</td>\\n<td>64,377</td>\\n<td>(4)%</td>\\n<td>66,952</td>\\n<td>(8)%</td>\\n<td>72,559</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Japan</td>\\n<td>28,703</td>\\n<td>15 %</td>\\n<td>25,052</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>24,257</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Rest of Asia Pacific</td>\\n<td>33,696</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>30,658</td>\\n<td>4 %</td>\\n<td>29,615</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>6 %</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>2 %</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n###### Americas  \\nAmericas net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the\\nsignificant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company\\'s\\nProducts net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company\\'s Services net sales, control transfers over\\ntime as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer\\nof control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.  \\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer\\nincentive programs based on the Company\\'s expectations and historical experience.  \\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the\\nCompany allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\"SSPs\").\\nWhen available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are\\nestablished that reflect the Company\\'s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they\\nwere sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\\'s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers\\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation\\nincluding, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings,\\nproduct-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.  \\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac\\nand iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the\\nhardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive\\ncertain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any\\nrelated discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable\\nprices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\\'s estimated SSPs. Revenue\\nallocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which\\ngenerally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized\\non a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.  \\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For\\nthese arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that\\nany unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized\\nrevenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.  \\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the\\nCompany recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when\\ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product,\\nretains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party\\napplications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the\\ncustomer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application-related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services\\nnet sales only the commission it retains.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 35\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe following table shows disaggregated net sales, as well as the portion of total net sales that was previously deferred, for\\n2025, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>iPhone</td>\\n<td>$ 209,586</td>\\n<td>$ 201,183</td>\\n<td>$ 200,583</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Mac</td>\\n<td>33,708</td>\\n<td>29,984</td>\\n<td>29,357</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>iPad</td>\\n<td>28,023</td>\\n<td>26,694</td>\\n<td>28,300</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Wearables, Home and Accessories</td>\\n<td>35,686</td>\\n<td>37,005</td>\\n<td>39,845</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Services (1)</td>\\n<td>109,158</td>\\n<td>96,169</td>\\n<td>85,200</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Portion of total net sales that was included in deferred revenue as of the beginning of the period</td>\\n<td>$ 8,229</td>\\n<td>$ 7,728</td>\\n<td>$ 8,169</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n(1) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.  \\nThe Company\\'s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment\\nin Note 13, \"Segment Information and Geographic Data\" for 2025, 2024 and 2023, except in Greater China, where iPhone\\nrevenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.  \\nAs of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the Company had total deferred revenue of $13.7 billion and $12.8 billion,\\nrespectively.

Significant\\nannouncements during fiscal year 2025 included the following:  \\nFirst Quarter 2025:  \\n· MacBook Pro  \\n· Mac mini  \\n· iMac  \\n· iPad mini  \\nSecond Quarter 2025:  \\n· iPhone 16e  \\n· iPad Air  \\n· iPad  \\n· MacBook Air  \\n· Mac Studio  \\nThird Quarter 2025:  \\n· iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, iPadOS 26, watchOS 26, visionOS 26 and tvOS 26  \\n##### Fourth Quarter 2025:  \\n. iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max  \\n. Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3 and Apple Watch Ultra 3  \\n· AirPods Pro 3  \\n##### Fiscal Period  \\nThe Company\\'s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is\\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\\'s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which\\noccurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company\\'s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year\\n2023 spanned 53 weeks.  \\n##### Macroeconomic Conditions  \\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and\\ncould in the future materially impact, the Company\\'s results of operations and financial condition.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 21\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### Tariffs and Other Measures  \\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2025, new U.S. Tariffs were announced, including additional tariffs on imports from China,\\nIndia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the EU, among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or\\nthreatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S.\\nTariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs\\nor other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the\\nTrade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing\\nequipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other\\nmeasures that are applied to the Company\\'s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company\\'s supply chain, the\\navailability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains\\nuncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are\\nannounced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the\\noverall magnitude and duration of these measures.

Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the\\nsignificant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company\\'s\\nProducts net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company\\'s Services net sales, control transfers over\\ntime as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer\\nof control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.  \\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer\\nincentive programs based on the Company\\'s expectations and historical experience.  \\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the\\nCompany allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\"SSPs\").\\nWhen available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are\\nestablished that reflect the Company\\'s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they\\nwere sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\\'s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers\\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation\\nincluding, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings,\\nproduct-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.  \\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac\\nand iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the\\nhardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive\\ncertain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any\\nrelated discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable\\nprices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\\'s estimated SSPs. Revenue\\nallocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which\\ngenerally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized\\non a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.  \\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For\\nthese arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that\\nany unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized\\nrevenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.  \\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the\\nCompany recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when\\ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product,\\nretains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party\\napplications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the\\ncustomer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application-related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services\\nnet sales only the commission it retains.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 35\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe following table shows disaggregated net sales, as well as the portion of total net sales that was previously deferred, for\\n2025, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>iPhone</td>\\n<td>$ 209,586</td>\\n<td>$ 201,183</td>\\n<td>$ 200,583</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Mac</td>\\n<td>33,708</td>\\n<td>29,984</td>\\n<td>29,357</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>iPad</td>\\n<td>28,023</td>\\n<td>26,694</td>\\n<td>28,300</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Wearables, Home and Accessories</td>\\n<td>35,686</td>\\n<td>37,005</td>\\n<td>39,845</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Services (1)</td>\\n<td>109,158</td>\\n<td>96,169</td>\\n<td>85,200</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Portion of total net sales that was included in deferred revenue as of the beginning of the period</td>\\n<td>$ 8,229</td>\\n<td>$ 7,728</td>\\n<td>$ 8,169</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n(1) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.  \\nThe Company\\'s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment\\nin Note 13, \"Segment Information and Geographic Data\" for 2025, 2024 and 2023, except in Greater China, where iPhone\\nrevenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.  \\nAs of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the Company had total deferred revenue of $13.7 billion and $12.8 billion,\\nrespectively.

Significant\\nannouncements during fiscal year 2025 included the following:  \\nFirst Quarter 2025:  \\n· MacBook Pro  \\n· Mac mini  \\n· iMac  \\n· iPad mini  \\nSecond Quarter 2025:  \\n· iPhone 16e  \\n· iPad Air  \\n· iPad  \\n· MacBook Air  \\n· Mac Studio  \\nThird Quarter 2025:  \\n· iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, iPadOS 26, watchOS 26, visionOS 26 and tvOS 26  \\n##### Fourth Quarter 2025:  \\n. iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max  \\n. Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3 and Apple Watch Ultra 3  \\n· AirPods Pro 3  \\n##### Fiscal Period  \\nThe Company\\'s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is\\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\\'s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which\\noccurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company\\'s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year\\n2023 spanned 53 weeks.  \\n##### Macroeconomic Conditions  \\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and\\ncould in the future materially impact, the Company\\'s results of operations and financial condition.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 21\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### Tariffs and Other Measures  \\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2025, new U.S. Tariffs were announced, including additional tariffs on imports from China,\\nIndia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the EU, among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or\\nthreatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S.\\nTariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs\\nor other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the\\nTrade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing\\nequipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other\\nmeasures that are applied to the Company\\'s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company\\'s supply chain, the\\navailability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains\\nuncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are\\nannounced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the\\noverall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the\\noverall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment\\nfor the Company\\'s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company\\'s business and results of\\noperations.  \\n##### Segment Operating Performance  \\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2025, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Americas</td>\\n<td>$ 178,353</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>$ 167,045</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>$ 162,560</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Europe</td>\\n<td>111,032</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>101,328</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>94,294</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Greater China</td>\\n<td>64,377</td>\\n<td>(4)%</td>\\n<td>66,952</td>\\n<td>(8)%</td>\\n<td>72,559</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Japan</td>\\n<td>28,703</td>\\n<td>15 %</td>\\n<td>25,052</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>24,257</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Rest of Asia Pacific</td>\\n<td>33,696</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>30,658</td>\\n<td>4 %</td>\\n<td>29,615</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>6 %</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>2 %</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n###### Americas  \\nAmericas net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

Company\\'s\\nmanagement to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, \"Summary of Significant\\nAccounting Policies\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the\\nsignificant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements.\\nManagement bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under\\nthe circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.  \\n##### Uncertain Tax Positions  \\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company\\'s\\nuncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and\\ninternational tax laws, including the TCJA and the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although\\nmanagement believes the Company\\'s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these\\nuncertainties will not be different from that reflected in the Company\\'s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing\\nfacts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination.

Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the\\nsignificant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company\\'s\\nProducts net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company\\'s Services net sales, control transfers over\\ntime as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer\\nof control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.  \\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer\\nincentive programs based on the Company\\'s expectations and historical experience.  \\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the\\nCompany allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\"SSPs\").\\nWhen available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are\\nestablished that reflect the Company\\'s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they\\nwere sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\\'s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers\\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation\\nincluding, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings,\\nproduct-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.  \\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac\\nand iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the\\nhardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive\\ncertain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any\\nrelated discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable\\nprices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\\'s estimated SSPs. Revenue\\nallocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which\\ngenerally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized\\non a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.  \\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For\\nthese arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that\\nany unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized\\nrevenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.  \\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the\\nCompany recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when\\ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product,\\nretains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party\\napplications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the\\ncustomer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application-related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services\\nnet sales only the commission it retains.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 35\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe following table shows disaggregated net sales, as well as the portion of total net sales that was previously deferred, for\\n2025, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>iPhone</td>\\n<td>$ 209,586</td>\\n<td>$ 201,183</td>\\n<td>$ 200,583</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Mac</td>\\n<td>33,708</td>\\n<td>29,984</td>\\n<td>29,357</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>iPad</td>\\n<td>28,023</td>\\n<td>26,694</td>\\n<td>28,300</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Wearables, Home and Accessories</td>\\n<td>35,686</td>\\n<td>37,005</td>\\n<td>39,845</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Services (1)</td>\\n<td>109,158</td>\\n<td>96,169</td>\\n<td>85,200</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Portion of total net sales that was included in deferred revenue as of the beginning of the period</td>\\n<td>$ 8,229</td>\\n<td>$ 7,728</td>\\n<td>$ 8,169</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n(1) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.  \\nThe Company\\'s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment\\nin Note 13, \"Segment Information and Geographic Data\" for 2025, 2024 and 2023, except in Greater China, where iPhone\\nrevenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.  \\nAs of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the Company had total deferred revenue of $13.7 billion and $12.8 billion,\\nrespectively.

The Company\\'s net sales and gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a\\nvariety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the\\nCompany may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\\'s ability to effectively stimulate demand\\nfor certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of\\ncomponents, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company\\'s services; the\\nCompany\\'s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the\\ngeographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product\\nand service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; the imposition of new\\nor increased tariffs and other trade restrictions, their overall magnitude and duration, and retaliatory actions in response; and the\\nintroduction of new products or services, including new products or services with lower profit margins. These and other factors\\ncould have a materially adverse impact on the Company\\'s results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Further, the\\nCompany generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product category and a decline in demand for that product\\ncould significantly impact net sales and gross margins.  \\n##### The Company\\'s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.  \\nThe Company\\'s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales, cost\\nof sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company\\'s products in foreign countries and on products that\\ninclude components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be\\nmaterially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.  \\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\\'s foreign\\ncurrency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing\\ndemand for the Company\\'s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to\\nraise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\\'s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross\\nmargins the Company earns on foreign currency-denominated sales.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 15\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\\'s foreign\\ncurrency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its\\nforeign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may\\nincrease the Company\\'s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.  \\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to\\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a\\nportion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are\\nin place.  \\n##### The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.  \\nThe Company\\'s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and\\neconomic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of\\nthe Company\\'s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Although the Company has not\\nrealized significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in\\nsignificant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\\'s results of operations, financial condition and stock\\nprice.  \\n##### The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.  \\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers and other resellers.\\nThe Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and\\ngovernment customers. A substantial majority of the Company\\'s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral,\\nthird-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company\\'s trade\\nreceivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company\\'s exposure to credit and\\ncollectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-\\ntrade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture\\nsubassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with\\nlong-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 27, 2025, the Company\\'s vendor non-\\ntrade receivables were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. If the Company is unable to\\nmonitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, the\\nCompany\\'s results of operations, financial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.  \\n##### The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.  \\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a\\nnumber of the Company\\'s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income\\ntaxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for\\nEconomic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the\\nintroduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company\\'s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings\\nin countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of\\nnew taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant\\njudgment and be subject to differing interpretations.  \\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service\\nand other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome\\nresulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. The outcome of such examinations is\\ninherently uncertain. If the Company\\'s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\\'s\\ntaxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\\'s business, results of operations, financial\\ncondition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 16\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->', name='company_retriever', id='ecc9b264-17bb-407f-8512-435b85c6330b', tool_call_id='call_YleJzMpeubLdIlW6DJPuddnd'),\n",

Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and\\ninsolvency.  \\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\\'s trade receivables; the\\nfailure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company\\'s ability to issue new debt; reduced\\nliquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company\\'s financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially\\nadversely affect the Company\\'s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 5\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe Company\\'s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical\\ntensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business\\ninterruptions.  \\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health\\nissues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can have a material adverse effect on the Company and its\\ncustomers, employees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other\\nchannel partners.  \\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\\'s total net sales,\\nand the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. A significant majority of the Company\\'s\\nmanufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South\\nKorea, Taiwan and Vietnam, in addition to sourcing from partners and facilities located in the U.S. Restrictions on international\\ntrade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the\\nCompany\\'s business and supply chain. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries\\nand regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations.\\nRestrictive measures can increase the cost or limit the availability of the Company\\'s products and the components and rare\\nearths and other raw materials that go into them. Restrictive measures can also require the Company to change suppliers,\\nrestructure business relationships and operations, refrain from offering and distributing or cease to offer and distribute affected\\nproducts, services and third-party applications to its customers, and increase the prices of its products and services. Changing\\nthe Company\\'s business and supply chain in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be\\nexpensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\\'s business and results of operations. Trade and other international\\ndisputes can also have an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in\\nconsumer spending and negative consumer sentiment for the Company\\'s products and services, all of which can further\\nadversely affect the Company\\'s business and results of operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance\\nnotice, which can create uncertainty, and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate any or all adverse impacts from\\nsuch measures. Global supply chains can be highly concentrated, and an escalation of geopolitical tensions or conflict could\\nresult in significant disruptions. Beginning in the second quarter of 2025, new tariffs were announced on imports to the U.S.\\n(\"U.S. Tariffs\"), including additional tariffs on imports from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the European\\nUnion (\"EU\"), among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or threatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports\\nfrom the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S. Tariffs have been announced and further\\nchanges could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs or other measures. For example, the U.S.\\nDepartment of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended,\\ninto, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products,\\nincluding downstream products that contain semiconductors. The ultimate impact remains uncertain and will depend on several\\nfactors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to what extent\\nother countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the overall magnitude and duration of these\\nmeasures. If disputes and conflicts further escalate, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and\\nrestrictive.  \\nMany of the Company\\'s operations, retail stores and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\\'s suppliers\\nand contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change is\\nresulting in certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. In\\naddition, the Company\\'s and its suppliers\\' operations, retail stores and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire,\\npower shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts,\\nransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company\\'s\\ncontrol.  \\nSuch events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create\\ndelays and inefficiencies in the Company\\'s supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\\'s\\nservice offerings, increase the Company\\'s costs, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas.  \\nThe Company\\'s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While\\nthe Company\\'s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur\\nand could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company\\'s business, and harm to the Company\\'s reputation.\\nMajor public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the\\nfuture materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products;\\nthe imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight\\nservices and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company\\'s operations, supply chain and sales\\nand distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays\\nin production ramps of new products and development of new services.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 6\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nFollowing any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, incur significant expenditures to\\nresume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and\\nmanufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative\\nconsequences to the Company. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance\\ncoverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. Any of the foregoing can materially adversely affect the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\n##### Global markets for the Company\\'s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.  \\nThe Company\\'s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets. These markets are characterized by\\naggressive price competition, downward pressure on gross margins, continual improvement in product performance, and price\\nsensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. These markets are further defined by frequent introduction of new products\\nand services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, and rapid adoption of technological advancements.  \\nThe Company\\'s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative\\nnew products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for\\nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the\\nCompany must make significant investments in R&D. These investments may not achieve expected returns, and the Company\\nmay not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.  \\nThe Company\\'s ability to compete successfully also depends on the effective protection and enforcement of its intellectual\\nproperty rights. Regulatory requirements, government investigations and litigation can force the Company to withdraw from, or\\nmodify its products and services for, certain countries and limit its ability to derive value from, or to enjoin others from using, its\\nintellectual property rights. Additionally, they may require the Company to share its innovations with competitors. Any of these\\noutcomes can have a negative impact on the Company\\'s competitive advantage and materially adversely affect its business,\\nresults of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to\\nregister, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company\\'s competitors seek to compete\\nprimarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\\'s products and infringing on\\nits intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the\\nCompany operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if\\ncompetitors infringe on the Company\\'s intellectual property, the Company\\'s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be\\nmaterially adversely affected.  \\nThe Company\\'s products and services face substantial competition from companies that have significant technical, marketing,\\ndistribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and service offerings. In addition, the Company faces\\nsignificant competition as competitors imitate the Company\\'s product features and applications within their products to offer more\\ncompetitive solutions. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company\\'s approach to\\nproviding components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. Some of the\\nCompany\\'s competitors have broad product lines, low-priced products, large installed bases of active devices, and large\\ncustomer bases. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product\\nmargins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products and services at little or no\\nprofit or even at a loss. The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer, tablet and\\nwearables markets, and some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no\\ngrowth or contracted overall.  \\nIf the Company is unable to compete successfully, its business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock\\nprice can be materially adversely affected.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 7\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n[3] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n#### Competition  \\nThe markets for the Company\\'s products and services are highly competitive and are characterized by aggressive price\\ncompetition, downward pressure on gross margins, continual improvement in product performance, and price sensitivity on the\\npart of consumers and businesses.

The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for\\nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal\\ncompetitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative\\nprice and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design and technology innovation, a strong third-party software\\nand accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, corporate reputation, and the ability to\\neffectively protect and enforce the Company\\'s intellectual property rights.  \\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables\\nand accessories, and services. The Company\\'s products and services face substantial competition from companies that have\\nsignificant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings\\nwith large customer bases. In addition, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\\'s product\\nfeatures and applications within their products to offer more competitive solutions.

The Company has a minority market share in the global\\nsmartphone, personal computer, tablet and wearables markets, and some of the markets in which the Company competes have\\nfrom time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.  \\n##### Supply of Components  \\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\\'s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with\\nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many\\ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide\\nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. Restrictions on international trade can increase the cost or limit the\\navailability of the Company\\'s products and the components and rare earths and other raw materials that go into them.  \\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by\\nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\\' yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have\\nincreased. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, the Company may not be\\nable to extend or renew agreements for the supply of components on similar terms, or at all, and may not be successful in\\nobtaining sufficient quantities from its suppliers or in a timely manner, or in identifying and obtaining sufficient quantities from an\\nalternative source. In addition, component suppliers may fail, be subject to consolidation within a particular industry, or decide to\\nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\\'s requirements,\\nfurther limiting the Company\\'s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\\n\\n[4] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n#### Product, Service and Software Announcements  \\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant\\nannouncements during fiscal year 2025 included the following:  \\nFirst Quarter 2025:  \\n· MacBook Pro  \\n· Mac mini  \\n· iMac  \\n· iPad mini  \\nSecond Quarter 2025:  \\n· iPhone 16e  \\n· iPad Air  \\n· iPad  \\n· MacBook Air  \\n· Mac Studio  \\nThird Quarter 2025:  \\n· iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, iPadOS 26, watchOS 26, visionOS 26 and tvOS 26  \\n##### Fourth Quarter 2025:  \\n. iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max  \\n. Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3 and Apple Watch Ultra 3  \\n· AirPods Pro 3  \\n##### Fiscal Period  \\nThe Company\\'s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is\\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\\'s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which\\noccurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company\\'s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year\\n2023 spanned 53 weeks.  \\n##### Macroeconomic Conditions  \\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and\\ncould in the future materially impact, the Company\\'s results of operations and financial condition.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 21\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### Tariffs and Other Measures  \\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2025, new U.S. Tariffs were announced, including additional tariffs on imports from China,\\nIndia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the EU, among others.

Many of the forward-looking statements are\\nlocated in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading \"Business\" and Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the heading\\n\"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" Forward-looking statements\\nprovide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly\\nrelate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-K regarding the potential future impact of\\nmacroeconomic conditions and tariffs and other measures on the Company\\'s business and results of operations are forward-\\nlooking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as \"future,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\"\\n\"estimates,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"predicts,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"could,\" \"can,\" \"may,\" and similar terms. Forward-\\nlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company\\'s actual results may differ significantly from the\\nresults discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to,\\nthose discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading \"Risk Factors.\" The Company assumes no obligation to\\nrevise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.  \\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company\\'s fiscal calendar, and references to\\nparticular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company\\'s fiscal years ended in September and the associated\\nquarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the \"Company\" and \"Apple\" as used herein refers\\ncollectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.\\n\\n[7] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n#### Critical Accounting Estimates  \\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\\n(\"GAAP\") and the Company\\'s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\\'s\\nmanagement to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, \"Summary of Significant\\nAccounting Policies\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the\\nsignificant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements.\\nManagement bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under\\nthe circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.  \\n##### Uncertain Tax Positions  \\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company\\'s\\nuncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and\\ninternational tax laws, including the TCJA and the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although\\nmanagement believes the Company\\'s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these\\nuncertainties will not be different from that reflected in the Company\\'s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing\\nfacts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent\\nwith management\\'s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\\'s financial condition and operating results.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 26\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### Legal and Other Contingencies  \\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of\\nwhich are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount is\\nreasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner\\ninconsistent with management\\'s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\\'s financial condition and operating\\nresults.\\n\\n[8] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n#### Business Risks  \\n##### To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.  \\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company\\nmust continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively\\nstimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, navigate global regulatory requirements and barriers\\nto market access, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of\\nnew product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including the Company\\'s ability to recruit and retain\\nhighly skilled personnel to execute on its strategic initiatives, and the timely and successful development and market acceptance\\nof new products, services and technologies. Success also relies on the Company\\'s ability to manage the risks associated with\\nnew technologies and production ramp-up issues, the effective integration of third-party services and technologies into the\\nCompany\\'s products and services, the availability, delivery and performance of application software or other third-party support\\nfor the Company\\'s products and services, the effective management of manufacturing and other purchase commitments and the\\nmanagement of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, and the availability of products in appropriate quantities\\nand at expected costs to meet anticipated demand. Additionally, quality issues or other defects or deficiencies can adversely\\naffect the success of new product and service introductions and market acceptance. New products, services and technologies\\nmay replace or supersede existing offerings and may produce lower revenues and lower profit margins. The Company may not\\nbe able to successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services, which can materially adversely\\naffect the Company\\'s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\n###### The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.  \\nA significant majority of the Company\\'s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily\\nin China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, in addition to sourcing from partners and facilities located in\\nthe U.S. The Company relies on single-source partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many\\ncomponents, and on partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company\\'s hardware\\nproducts. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements\\ncan lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\\'s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished\\ncontrol has from time to time had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on the cost, quality or quantity of products\\nmanufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company\\'s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although\\narrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally\\nremains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences\\nunanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code\\nof conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company\\'s\\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\nChanges or additions to the Company\\'s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and\\nuncertainties, including exposure to additional regulatory and operational risks.  \\n####### Future operating results depend upon the Company\\'s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.  \\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant\\nsupply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to\\nindustry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company\\'s\\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the\\npast experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company\\'s ability to obtain sufficient\\nquantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future.  \\nAdditionally, the Company\\'s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component\\nor product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\\' yields have matured or their\\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The Company may not be able to extend or renew agreements for the supply of\\ncomponents on similar terms, or at all, and may not be successful in obtaining sufficient quantities from its suppliers in a timely\\nmanner, or in identifying and obtaining sufficient quantities from an alternative source. In addition, component suppliers may fail,\\nbe subject to consolidation within a particular industry, or decide to concentrate on the production of common components\\ninstead of components customized to meet the Company\\'s requirements, further limiting the Company\\'s ability to obtain sufficient\\nquantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant\\nrisks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial\\ncondition and stock price.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 8\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n###### The Company\\'s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business and result in harm to the Company\\'s reputation.  \\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing\\ndefects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues\\nthat can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist\\nin components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company\\'s\\nproducts unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the\\nCompany\\'s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company\\'s service offerings\\ncan have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the\\nCompany\\'s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. The introduction of new and\\ncomplex technologies, such as artificial intelligence features, can increase these and other safety risks, including exposing users\\nto harmful, inaccurate or other negative content and experiences. The Company may not be able to detect and fix all issues and\\ndefects in the hardware, software and services it offers, which can result in widespread technical and performance issues\\naffecting the Company\\'s products and services. Errors, bugs and vulnerabilities can be exploited by third parties, compromising\\nthe safety and security of a user\\'s device. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product\\nreplacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant\\nwarranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can adversely affect the\\nexperience for users of the Company\\'s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\\'s reputation, loss of\\ncompetitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service\\nintroductions and lost sales.  \\n##### The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.  \\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories if cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company\\nreviews other assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\\' facilities, inventory prepayments and other long-lived assets,\\nfor impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. Although the Company believes\\nits inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets are currently recoverable, the Company may incur write-\\ndowns, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which\\nthe Company competes.  \\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments.\\nManufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company\\'s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for\\nperiods up to 150 days. Because the Company\\'s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price\\nchanges, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components\\nor products, or not fully utilize purchase commitments. The Company accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of\\nexcess products and components.  \\n##### The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.  \\nThe Company\\'s products and services include technology or intellectual property that must be licensed from third parties. In\\naddition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may\\ncompete, current extensive intellectual property coverage and the rapid rate of new intellectual property rights generation, the\\nCompany\\'s products and services may be alleged to infringe existing intellectual property rights of others. This risk may be\\nexacerbated by the use of new and emerging technologies, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, which can\\ninvolve, among other things, the acquisition and use of copyrighted materials for training as well as the potential reproduction of\\ncopyrighted materials in their outputs. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain\\nintellectual property rights of third parties. The Company is not always able to obtain all necessary licenses to third-party\\nintellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual\\nproperty, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can require the Company to modify certain\\nproducts, services or features or preclude the Company from selling certain products or services and expose the Company to\\nsignificant licensing costs, all of which can materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, reputation, results of operations,\\nfinancial condition and stock price.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 9\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### The Company\\'s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.  \\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party\\nsoftware applications and services. Third-party developers may discontinue the development and maintenance of software\\napplications and services for the Company\\'s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed\\nand maintained for the Company\\'s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\\'s products, adversely impacting the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\nThe Company believes that third-party developer support depends on the perceived benefits of creating software and services\\nfor the Company\\'s products compared to competitors\\' platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for\\npersonal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on\\nfactors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected\\nfuture growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.  \\nThe Company\\'s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer, tablet and wearables markets can make\\ndevelopers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company\\'s products and more inclined to devote their resources\\nto developing and upgrading software for competitors\\' products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on\\nthese competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company\\'s devices can suffer.  \\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its\\nproducts. The Company\\'s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party\\ndevelopers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these\\nchanges to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower\\ncustomer demand for the Company\\'s products.  \\n###### Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company\\'s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition.  \\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or\\noffer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company\\'s own services.\\nThe licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the\\ncontinuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers\\nand distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or\\nimpossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may\\nseek to limit the Company\\'s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a\\nwide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.  \\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for\\ntalent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company\\'s customers.  \\n####### The Company\\'s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company\\'s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture.  \\nMuch of the Company\\'s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and\\nservice of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced\\npersonnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley,\\nwhere most of the Company\\'s key personnel are located. Periods of intense competition for talent in particular fields can lead to\\nincreased costs as the Company seeks to offer competitive compensation to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. In\\naddition to competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving and the Company must navigate changes\\neffectively in order to achieve its strategic initiatives. Laws and regulations, including immigration, labor and employment laws\\nand export controls, among others, can materially adversely affect the Company\\'s ability to recruit and retain a highly skilled,\\nglobal workforce. If the Company does not effectively manage changing workforce dynamics and regulatory requirements, it\\ncould materially adversely affect the Company\\'s culture, operational flexibility, strategy and costs, all of which can materially\\nadversely affect the Company\\'s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\nThe Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to\\nnurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company\\'s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who\\nare critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, reputation, results of\\noperations, financial condition and stock price.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 10\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### The Company depends on the performance of carriers and other resellers.  \\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers and other resellers, many of\\nwhich distribute products and services from competitors. Resellers offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for\\nusers\\' purchases of devices, and such plans may be discontinued or modified any time.  \\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected\\nresellers\\' stores with Company employees and contractors, improving product placement displays, and developing and making\\ndigital marketing assets available to resellers. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or\\nincremental sales. For example, the purchasing preferences and behaviors of consumers may change, the financial condition of\\nresellers could weaken, resellers could stop distributing the Company\\'s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or\\nall of the Company\\'s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company\\'s products, all of\\nwhich could materially adversely impact the Company\\'s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\n###### The Company\\'s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions.  \\nThe Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to\\ninformation technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions,\\ntelecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other\\ncybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be\\nineffective or inadequate, and the Company\\'s or its vendors\\' business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be\\nsufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company\\'s business by, among other things,\\npreventing access to the Company\\'s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and\\nshipping of the Company\\'s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, reputation, results\\nof operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\n###### Losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.  \\nThe Company\\'s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal and sensitive health and\\nfinancial information with respect to the Company\\'s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to\\nsystems and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems\\nand data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential\\ninformation occur and could materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, reputation, results of operations, financial\\ncondition and stock price.  \\nThe Company\\'s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company\\nrelies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations.\\nAlthough the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on\\nthe Company\\'s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential\\ninformation occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business,\\nreputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis.\\nThese attacks target the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information and may disrupt normal business\\noperations. Attacks can impair the Company\\'s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, affect its stock\\nprice, damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, potentially resulting\\nin penalties, fines or judgments. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with\\nincreasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or\\nobfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company\\'s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In\\naddition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of geopolitical tensions or conflict.  \\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many\\ncompanies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and\\nthe value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 11\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nAs with all companies, the security the Company has implemented may not be sufficient for all eventualities and are vulnerable\\nto hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities.\\nFor example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company\\'s or its suppliers\\' and other third parties\\' employees or\\ncustomers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized\\naccess to the Company\\'s or such suppliers\\' or third parties\\' systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company,\\nthe Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for\\nunusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or\\nloss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company\\'s products and services.  \\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such\\ninsurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.  \\n###### Investment in new business strategies, commercial relationships and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\\'s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated, and materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.  \\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies, commercial relationships and acquisitions.\\nSuch endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations,\\ngreater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in\\nnew businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and\\nsignificant write-offs.

Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3 and Apple Watch Ultra 3  \\n· AirPods Pro 3  \\n##### Fiscal Period  \\nThe Company\\'s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is\\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\\'s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which\\noccurred in the first quarter of 2023.

In response, several countries have imposed, or\\nthreatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S.\\nTariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs\\nor other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the\\nTrade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing\\nequipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other\\nmeasures that are applied to the Company\\'s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company\\'s supply chain, the\\navailability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains\\nuncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are\\nannounced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the\\noverall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the\\noverall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment\\nfor the Company\\'s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company\\'s business and results of\\noperations.  \\n##### Segment Operating Performance  \\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2025, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Americas</td>\\n<td>$ 178,353</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>$ 167,045</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>$ 162,560</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Europe</td>\\n<td>111,032</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>101,328</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>94,294</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Greater China</td>\\n<td>64,377</td>\\n<td>(4)%</td>\\n<td>66,952</td>\\n<td>(8)%</td>\\n<td>72,559</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Japan</td>\\n<td>28,703</td>\\n<td>15 %</td>\\n<td>25,052</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>24,257</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Rest of Asia Pacific</td>\\n<td>33,696</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>30,658</td>\\n<td>4 %</td>\\n<td>29,615</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>6 %</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>2 %</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n###### Americas  \\nAmericas net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

The Company\\'s net sales and gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a\\nvariety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the\\nCompany may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\\'s ability to effectively stimulate demand\\nfor certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of\\ncomponents, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company\\'s services; the\\nCompany\\'s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the\\ngeographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product\\nand service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; the imposition of new\\nor increased tariffs and other trade restrictions, their overall magnitude and duration, and retaliatory actions in response; and the\\nintroduction of new products or services, including new products or services with lower profit margins. These and other factors\\ncould have a materially adverse impact on the Company\\'s results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Further, the\\nCompany generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product category and a decline in demand for that product\\ncould significantly impact net sales and gross margins.  \\n##### The Company\\'s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.  \\nThe Company\\'s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales, cost\\nof sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company\\'s products in foreign countries and on products that\\ninclude components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be\\nmaterially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.  \\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\\'s foreign\\ncurrency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing\\ndemand for the Company\\'s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to\\nraise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\\'s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross\\nmargins the Company earns on foreign currency-denominated sales.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 15\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\\'s foreign\\ncurrency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its\\nforeign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may\\nincrease the Company\\'s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.  \\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to\\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a\\nportion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are\\nin place.  \\n##### The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.  \\nThe Company\\'s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and\\neconomic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of\\nthe Company\\'s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Although the Company has not\\nrealized significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in\\nsignificant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\\'s results of operations, financial condition and stock\\nprice.  \\n##### The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.  \\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers and other resellers.\\nThe Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and\\ngovernment customers. A substantial majority of the Company\\'s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral,\\nthird-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company\\'s trade\\nreceivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company\\'s exposure to credit and\\ncollectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-\\ntrade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture\\nsubassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with\\nlong-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 27, 2025, the Company\\'s vendor non-\\ntrade receivables were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. If the Company is unable to\\nmonitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, the\\nCompany\\'s results of operations, financial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.  \\n##### The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.  \\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a\\nnumber of the Company\\'s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income\\ntaxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for\\nEconomic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the\\nintroduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company\\'s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings\\nin countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of\\nnew taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant\\njudgment and be subject to differing interpretations.  \\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service\\nand other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome\\nresulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. The outcome of such examinations is\\ninherently uncertain. If the Company\\'s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\\'s\\ntaxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\\'s business, results of operations, financial\\ncondition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 16\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n[8] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n# Apple Inc.

Significant\\nannouncements during fiscal year 2025 included the following:  \\nFirst Quarter 2025:  \\n· MacBook Pro  \\n· Mac mini  \\n· iMac  \\n· iPad mini  \\nSecond Quarter 2025:  \\n· iPhone 16e  \\n· iPad Air  \\n· iPad  \\n· MacBook Air  \\n· Mac Studio  \\nThird Quarter 2025:  \\n· iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, iPadOS 26, watchOS 26, visionOS 26 and tvOS 26  \\n##### Fourth Quarter 2025:  \\n. iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max  \\n. Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3 and Apple Watch Ultra 3  \\n· AirPods Pro 3  \\n##### Fiscal Period  \\nThe Company\\'s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is\\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\\'s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which\\noccurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company\\'s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year\\n2023 spanned 53 weeks.  \\n##### Macroeconomic Conditions  \\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and\\ncould in the future materially impact, the Company\\'s results of operations and financial condition.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 21\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### Tariffs and Other Measures  \\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2025, new U.S. Tariffs were announced, including additional tariffs on imports from China,\\nIndia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the EU, among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or\\nthreatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S.\\nTariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs\\nor other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the\\nTrade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing\\nequipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other\\nmeasures that are applied to the Company\\'s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company\\'s supply chain, the\\navailability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains\\nuncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are\\nannounced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the\\noverall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the\\noverall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment\\nfor the Company\\'s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company\\'s business and results of\\noperations.  \\n##### Segment Operating Performance  \\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2025, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Americas</td>\\n<td>$ 178,353</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>$ 167,045</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>$ 162,560</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Europe</td>\\n<td>111,032</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>101,328</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>94,294</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Greater China</td>\\n<td>64,377</td>\\n<td>(4)%</td>\\n<td>66,952</td>\\n<td>(8)%</td>\\n<td>72,559</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Japan</td>\\n<td>28,703</td>\\n<td>15 %</td>\\n<td>25,052</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>24,257</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Rest of Asia Pacific</td>\\n<td>33,696</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>30,658</td>\\n<td>4 %</td>\\n<td>29,615</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>6 %</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>2 %</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n###### Americas  \\nAmericas net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

be entitled when control of products or services is\\ntransferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the\\nsignificant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company\\'s\\nProducts net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company\\'s Services net sales, control transfers over\\ntime as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer\\nof control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.  \\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer\\nincentive programs based on the Company\\'s expectations and historical experience.  \\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the\\nCompany allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\"SSPs\").\\nWhen available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are\\nestablished that reflect the Company\\'s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they\\nwere sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\\'s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers\\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation\\nincluding, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings,\\nproduct-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.  \\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac\\nand iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the\\nhardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive\\ncertain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any\\nrelated discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable\\nprices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\\'s estimated SSPs. Revenue\\nallocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which\\ngenerally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized\\non a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.  \\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For\\nthese arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that\\nany unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized\\nrevenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.  \\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the\\nCompany recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when\\ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product,\\nretains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party\\napplications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the\\ncustomer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application-related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services\\nnet sales only the commission it retains.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 35\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe following table shows disaggregated net sales, as well as the portion of total net sales that was previously deferred, for\\n2025, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>iPhone</td>\\n<td>$ 209,586</td>\\n<td>$ 201,183</td>\\n<td>$ 200,583</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Mac</td>\\n<td>33,708</td>\\n<td>29,984</td>\\n<td>29,357</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>iPad</td>\\n<td>28,023</td>\\n<td>26,694</td>\\n<td>28,300</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Wearables, Home and Accessories</td>\\n<td>35,686</td>\\n<td>37,005</td>\\n<td>39,845</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Services (1)</td>\\n<td>109,158</td>\\n<td>96,169</td>\\n<td>85,200</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Portion of total net sales that was included in deferred revenue as of the beginning of the period</td>\\n<td>$ 8,229</td>\\n<td>$ 7,728</td>\\n<td>$ 8,169</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n(1) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.  \\nThe Company\\'s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment\\nin Note 13, \"Segment Information and Geographic Data\" for 2025, 2024 and 2023, except in Greater China, where iPhone\\nrevenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.  \\nAs of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the Company had total deferred revenue of $13.7 billion and $12.8 billion,\\nrespectively.

Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the\\nCompany\\'s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework\\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company\\'s\\nassessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 27, 2025\\nto provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in\\naccordance with GAAP. The Company\\'s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit\\nreport on the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\\n\\n[6] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n#### Product, Service and Software Announcements  \\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant\\nannouncements during fiscal year 2025 included the following:  \\nFirst Quarter 2025:  \\n· MacBook Pro  \\n· Mac mini  \\n· iMac  \\n· iPad mini  \\nSecond Quarter 2025:  \\n· iPhone 16e  \\n· iPad Air  \\n· iPad  \\n· MacBook Air  \\n· Mac Studio  \\nThird Quarter 2025:  \\n· iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, iPadOS 26, watchOS 26, visionOS 26 and tvOS 26  \\n##### Fourth Quarter 2025:  \\n. iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max  \\n. Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3 and Apple Watch Ultra 3  \\n· AirPods Pro 3  \\n##### Fiscal Period  \\nThe Company\\'s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is\\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\\'s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which\\noccurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company\\'s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year\\n2023 spanned 53 weeks.  \\n##### Macroeconomic Conditions  \\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and\\ncould in the future materially impact, the Company\\'s results of operations and financial condition.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 21\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### Tariffs and Other Measures  \\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2025, new U.S. Tariffs were announced, including additional tariffs on imports from China,\\nIndia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the EU, among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or\\nthreatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S.\\nTariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs\\nor other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the\\nTrade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing\\nequipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other\\nmeasures that are applied to the Company\\'s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company\\'s supply chain, the\\navailability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains\\nuncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are\\nannounced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the\\noverall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the\\noverall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment\\nfor the Company\\'s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company\\'s business and results of\\noperations.  \\n##### Segment Operating Performance  \\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2025, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Americas</td>\\n<td>$ 178,353</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>$ 167,045</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>$ 162,560</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Europe</td>\\n<td>111,032</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>101,328</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>94,294</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Greater China</td>\\n<td>64,377</td>\\n<td>(4)%</td>\\n<td>66,952</td>\\n<td>(8)%</td>\\n<td>72,559</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Japan</td>\\n<td>28,703</td>\\n<td>15 %</td>\\n<td>25,052</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>24,257</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Rest of Asia Pacific</td>\\n<td>33,696</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>30,658</td>\\n<td>4 %</td>\\n<td>29,615</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>6 %</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>2 %</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n###### Americas  \\nAmericas net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

Significant\\nannouncements during fiscal year 2025 included the following:  \\nFirst Quarter 2025:  \\n· MacBook Pro  \\n· Mac mini  \\n· iMac  \\n· iPad mini  \\nSecond Quarter 2025:  \\n· iPhone 16e  \\n· iPad Air  \\n· iPad  \\n· MacBook Air  \\n· Mac Studio  \\nThird Quarter 2025:  \\n· iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, iPadOS 26, watchOS 26, visionOS 26 and tvOS 26  \\n##### Fourth Quarter 2025:  \\n. iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max  \\n. Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3 and Apple Watch Ultra 3  \\n· AirPods Pro 3  \\n##### Fiscal Period  \\nThe Company\\'s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is\\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\\'s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which\\noccurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company\\'s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year\\n2023 spanned 53 weeks.  \\n##### Macroeconomic Conditions  \\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and\\ncould in the future materially impact, the Company\\'s results of operations and financial condition.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 21\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### Tariffs and Other Measures  \\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2025, new U.S. Tariffs were announced, including additional tariffs on imports from China,\\nIndia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the EU, among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or\\nthreatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S.\\nTariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs\\nor other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the\\nTrade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing\\nequipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other\\nmeasures that are applied to the Company\\'s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company\\'s supply chain, the\\navailability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains\\nuncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are\\nannounced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the\\noverall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the\\noverall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment\\nfor the Company\\'s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company\\'s business and results of\\noperations.  \\n##### Segment Operating Performance  \\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2025, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Americas</td>\\n<td>$ 178,353</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>$ 167,045</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>$ 162,560</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Europe</td>\\n<td>111,032</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>101,328</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>94,294</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Greater China</td>\\n<td>64,377</td>\\n<td>(4)%</td>\\n<td>66,952</td>\\n<td>(8)%</td>\\n<td>72,559</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Japan</td>\\n<td>28,703</td>\\n<td>15 %</td>\\n<td>25,052</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>24,257</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Rest of Asia Pacific</td>\\n<td>33,696</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>30,658</td>\\n<td>4 %</td>\\n<td>29,615</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>6 %</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>2 %</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n###### Americas  \\nAmericas net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

Statements in this section are based on the Company\\'s beliefs and opinions regarding matters that could materially\\nadversely affect the Company in the future and are not representations as to whether such matters have or have not occurred\\npreviously. The risks and uncertainties described below are not exhaustive and should not be considered a complete statement\\nof all potential risks or uncertainties that the Company faces or may face in the future.  \\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\\nand Results of Operations\" and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial\\nStatements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K.\\n\\n[2] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n### Item 7. Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  \\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes\\nincluded in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2025 and 2024 items and year-to-year comparisons\\nbetween 2025 and 2024. Discussions of 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023 are not included,\\nand can be found in \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item\\n7 of the Company\\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024.\\n\\n[3] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n#### Financial Risks  \\n##### The Company\\'s net sales and gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors.  \\nThe Company\\'s gross margins vary significantly across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels\\nand can change over time. The Company\\'s net sales and gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a\\nvariety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the\\nCompany may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\\'s ability to effectively stimulate demand\\nfor certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of\\ncomponents, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company\\'s services; the\\nCompany\\'s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the\\ngeographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product\\nand service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; the imposition of new\\nor increased tariffs and other trade restrictions, their overall magnitude and duration, and retaliatory actions in response; and the\\nintroduction of new products or services, including new products or services with lower profit margins. These and other factors\\ncould have a materially adverse impact on the Company\\'s results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Further, the\\nCompany generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product category and a decline in demand for that product\\ncould significantly impact net sales and gross margins.  \\n##### The Company\\'s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.  \\nThe Company\\'s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales, cost\\nof sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company\\'s products in foreign countries and on products that\\ninclude components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be\\nmaterially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.  \\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\\'s foreign\\ncurrency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing\\ndemand for the Company\\'s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to\\nraise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\\'s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross\\nmargins the Company earns on foreign currency-denominated sales.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 15\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\\'s foreign\\ncurrency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its\\nforeign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may\\nincrease the Company\\'s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.  \\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to\\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a\\nportion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are\\nin place.  \\n##### The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.  \\nThe Company\\'s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and\\neconomic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of\\nthe Company\\'s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Although the Company has not\\nrealized significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in\\nsignificant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\\'s results of operations, financial condition and stock\\nprice.  \\n##### The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.  \\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers and other resellers.\\nThe Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and\\ngovernment customers. A substantial majority of the Company\\'s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral,\\nthird-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company\\'s trade\\nreceivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company\\'s exposure to credit and\\ncollectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-\\ntrade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture\\nsubassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with\\nlong-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 27, 2025, the Company\\'s vendor non-\\ntrade receivables were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. If the Company is unable to\\nmonitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, the\\nCompany\\'s results of operations, financial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.  \\n##### The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.  \\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a\\nnumber of the Company\\'s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income\\ntaxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for\\nEconomic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the\\nintroduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company\\'s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings\\nin countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of\\nnew taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant\\njudgment and be subject to differing interpretations.  \\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service\\nand other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome\\nresulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. The outcome of such examinations is\\ninherently uncertain. If the Company\\'s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\\'s\\ntaxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\\'s business, results of operations, financial\\ncondition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 16\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n[4] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n#### Interest Rate Risk  \\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company\\'s investment portfolio\\nand term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company\\'s investment portfolio and increase\\nthe interest expense on the Company\\'s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative\\ninstruments, offset interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.  \\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company\\'s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any\\nassociated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September 27, 2025 and\\nSeptember 28, 2024 (dollars in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Interest Rate Sensitive Instrument</th>\\n<th>Hypothetical Interest Rate Increase</th>\\n<th>Potential Impact</th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Investment portfolio</td>\\n<td>100 basis points, all tenors</td>\\n<td>Decline in fair value</td>\\n<td>$ 2,416</td>\\n<td>$ 2,755</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Term debt</td>\\n<td>100 basis points, all tenors</td>\\n<td>Increase in annual interest expense</td>\\n<td>$ 129</td>\\n<td>$ 139</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>\\n\\n[5] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n#### Foreign Exchange Rate Risk  \\nThe Company\\'s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other\\nthan the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the\\nCompany\\'s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair\\nvalues of certain of the Company\\'s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use\\nderivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company\\nmay choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or\\nprohibitive cost.  \\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (\"VAR\") model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of\\nfluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair\\nvalue, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\\'s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates.\\nBased on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $590\\nmillion and $538 million as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, respectively. Changes in the Company\\'s underlying\\nforeign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the\\nCompany\\'s foreign currency derivatives.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 27\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n[6] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n#### Macroeconomic and Industry Risks  \\nThe Company\\'s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and\\nadverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, results of operations, financial\\ncondition and stock price.  \\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\\'s total net sales.\\nIn addition, the Company\\'s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company\\'s supplier facilities, including\\nmanufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company\\'s operations and performance depend\\nsignificantly on global and regional economic conditions.  \\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher\\ninterest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely\\naffect demand for the Company\\'s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially\\nadversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset\\nvalues, and other economic factors.  \\nUncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can also have a significant impact on the Company\\'s\\nsuppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and\\ndevelopers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and\\ninsolvency.  \\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\\'s trade receivables; the\\nfailure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company\\'s ability to issue new debt; reduced\\nliquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company\\'s financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially\\nadversely affect the Company\\'s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 5\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe Company\\'s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical\\ntensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business\\ninterruptions.  \\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health\\nissues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can have a material adverse effect on the Company and its\\ncustomers, employees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other\\nchannel partners.  \\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\\'s total net sales,\\nand the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. A significant majority of the Company\\'s\\nmanufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South\\nKorea, Taiwan and Vietnam, in addition to sourcing from partners and facilities located in the U.S. Restrictions on international\\ntrade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the\\nCompany\\'s business and supply chain. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries\\nand regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations.\\nRestrictive measures can increase the cost or limit the availability of the Company\\'s products and the components and rare\\nearths and other raw materials that go into them. Restrictive measures can also require the Company to change suppliers,\\nrestructure business relationships and operations, refrain from offering and distributing or cease to offer and distribute affected\\nproducts, services and third-party applications to its customers, and increase the prices of its products and services. Changing\\nthe Company\\'s business and supply chain in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be\\nexpensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\\'s business and results of operations. Trade and other international\\ndisputes can also have an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in\\nconsumer spending and negative consumer sentiment for the Company\\'s products and services, all of which can further\\nadversely affect the Company\\'s business and results of operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance\\nnotice, which can create uncertainty, and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate any or all adverse impacts from\\nsuch measures. Global supply chains can be highly concentrated, and an escalation of geopolitical tensions or conflict could\\nresult in significant disruptions. Beginning in the second quarter of 2025, new tariffs were announced on imports to the U.S.\\n(\"U.S. Tariffs\"), including additional tariffs on imports from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the European\\nUnion (\"EU\"), among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or threatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports\\nfrom the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S. Tariffs have been announced and further\\nchanges could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs or other measures. For example, the U.S.\\nDepartment of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended,\\ninto, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products,\\nincluding downstream products that contain semiconductors. The ultimate impact remains uncertain and will depend on several\\nfactors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to what extent\\nother countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the overall magnitude and duration of these\\nmeasures. If disputes and conflicts further escalate, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and\\nrestrictive.  \\nMany of the Company\\'s operations, retail stores and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\\'s suppliers\\nand contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change is\\nresulting in certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. In\\naddition, the Company\\'s and its suppliers\\' operations, retail stores and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire,\\npower shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts,\\nransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company\\'s\\ncontrol.  \\nSuch events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create\\ndelays and inefficiencies in the Company\\'s supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\\'s\\nservice offerings, increase the Company\\'s costs, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas.  \\nThe Company\\'s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While\\nthe Company\\'s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur\\nand could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company\\'s business, and harm to the Company\\'s reputation.\\nMajor public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the\\nfuture materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products;\\nthe imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight\\nservices and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company\\'s operations, supply chain and sales\\nand distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays\\nin production ramps of new products and development of new services.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 6\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nFollowing any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, incur significant expenditures to\\nresume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and\\nmanufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative\\nconsequences to the Company. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance\\ncoverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. Any of the foregoing can materially adversely affect the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\n##### Global markets for the Company\\'s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.  \\nThe Company\\'s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets. These markets are characterized by\\naggressive price competition, downward pressure on gross margins, continual improvement in product performance, and price\\nsensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. These markets are further defined by frequent introduction of new products\\nand services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, and rapid adoption of technological advancements.  \\nThe Company\\'s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative\\nnew products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for\\nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the\\nCompany must make significant investments in R&D. These investments may not achieve expected returns, and the Company\\nmay not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.  \\nThe Company\\'s ability to compete successfully also depends on the effective protection and enforcement of its intellectual\\nproperty rights. Regulatory requirements, government investigations and litigation can force the Company to withdraw from, or\\nmodify its products and services for, certain countries and limit its ability to derive value from, or to enjoin others from using, its\\nintellectual property rights. Additionally, they may require the Company to share its innovations with competitors. Any of these\\noutcomes can have a negative impact on the Company\\'s competitive advantage and materially adversely affect its business,\\nresults of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to\\nregister, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company\\'s competitors seek to compete\\nprimarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\\'s products and infringing on\\nits intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the\\nCompany operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if\\ncompetitors infringe on the Company\\'s intellectual property, the Company\\'s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be\\nmaterially adversely affected.  \\nThe Company\\'s products and services face substantial competition from companies that have significant technical, marketing,\\ndistribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and service offerings. In addition, the Company faces\\nsignificant competition as competitors imitate the Company\\'s product features and applications within their products to offer more\\ncompetitive solutions. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company\\'s approach to\\nproviding components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. Some of the\\nCompany\\'s competitors have broad product lines, low-priced products, large installed bases of active devices, and large\\ncustomer bases. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product\\nmargins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products and services at little or no\\nprofit or even at a loss. The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer, tablet and\\nwearables markets, and some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no\\ngrowth or contracted overall.  \\nIf the Company is unable to compete successfully, its business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock\\nprice can be materially adversely affected.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 7\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n[7] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n### Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  \\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies\\nto manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements.\\n\\n[8] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n#### Critical Accounting Estimates  \\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\\n(\"GAAP\") and the Company\\'s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\\'s\\nmanagement to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, \"Summary of Significant\\nAccounting Policies\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the\\nsignificant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements.\\nManagement bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under\\nthe circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.  \\n##### Uncertain Tax Positions  \\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company\\'s\\nuncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and\\ninternational tax laws, including the TCJA and the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although\\nmanagement believes the Company\\'s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these\\nuncertainties will not be different from that reflected in the Company\\'s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing\\nfacts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent\\nwith management\\'s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\\'s financial condition and operating results.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 26\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### Legal and Other Contingencies  \\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of\\nwhich are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount is\\nreasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment.
