In response, several countries have imposed, or\\nthreatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S.\\nTariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs\\nor other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the\\nTrade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing\\nequipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other\\nmeasures that are applied to the Company\\'s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company\\'s supply chain, the\\navailability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains\\nuncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are\\nannounced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the\\noverall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the\\noverall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment\\nfor the Company\\'s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company\\'s business and results of\\noperations.  \\n##### Segment Operating Performance  \\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2025, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Americas</td>\\n<td>$ 178,353</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>$ 167,045</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>$ 162,560</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Europe</td>\\n<td>111,032</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>101,328</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>94,294</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Greater China</td>\\n<td>64,377</td>\\n<td>(4)%</td>\\n<td>66,952</td>\\n<td>(8)%</td>\\n<td>72,559</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Japan</td>\\n<td>28,703</td>\\n<td>15 %</td>\\n<td>25,052</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>24,257</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Rest of Asia Pacific</td>\\n<td>33,696</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>30,658</td>\\n<td>4 %</td>\\n<td>29,615</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>6 %</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>2 %</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n###### Americas  \\nAmericas net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

Significant\\nannouncements during fiscal year 2025 included the following:  \\nFirst Quarter 2025:  \\n· MacBook Pro  \\n· Mac mini  \\n· iMac  \\n· iPad mini  \\nSecond Quarter 2025:  \\n· iPhone 16e  \\n· iPad Air  \\n· iPad  \\n· MacBook Air  \\n· Mac Studio  \\nThird Quarter 2025:  \\n· iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, iPadOS 26, watchOS 26, visionOS 26 and tvOS 26  \\n##### Fourth Quarter 2025:  \\n. iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max  \\n. Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3 and Apple Watch Ultra 3  \\n· AirPods Pro 3  \\n##### Fiscal Period  \\nThe Company\\'s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is\\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\\'s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which\\noccurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company\\'s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year\\n2023 spanned 53 weeks.  \\n##### Macroeconomic Conditions  \\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and\\ncould in the future materially impact, the Company\\'s results of operations and financial condition.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 21\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### Tariffs and Other Measures  \\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2025, new U.S. Tariffs were announced, including additional tariffs on imports from China,\\nIndia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the EU, among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or\\nthreatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S.\\nTariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs\\nor other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the\\nTrade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing\\nequipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other\\nmeasures that are applied to the Company\\'s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company\\'s supply chain, the\\navailability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains\\nuncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are\\nannounced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the\\noverall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the\\noverall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment\\nfor the Company\\'s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company\\'s business and results of\\noperations.  \\n##### Segment Operating Performance  \\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2025, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Americas</td>\\n<td>$ 178,353</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>$ 167,045</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>$ 162,560</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Europe</td>\\n<td>111,032</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>101,328</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>94,294</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Greater China</td>\\n<td>64,377</td>\\n<td>(4)%</td>\\n<td>66,952</td>\\n<td>(8)%</td>\\n<td>72,559</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Japan</td>\\n<td>28,703</td>\\n<td>15 %</td>\\n<td>25,052</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>24,257</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Rest of Asia Pacific</td>\\n<td>33,696</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>30,658</td>\\n<td>4 %</td>\\n<td>29,615</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>6 %</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>2 %</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n###### Americas  \\nAmericas net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

Significant\\nannouncements during fiscal year 2025 included the following:  \\nFirst Quarter 2025:  \\n· MacBook Pro  \\n· Mac mini  \\n· iMac  \\n· iPad mini  \\nSecond Quarter 2025:  \\n· iPhone 16e  \\n· iPad Air  \\n· iPad  \\n· MacBook Air  \\n· Mac Studio  \\nThird Quarter 2025:  \\n· iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, iPadOS 26, watchOS 26, visionOS 26 and tvOS 26  \\n##### Fourth Quarter 2025:  \\n. iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max  \\n. Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3 and Apple Watch Ultra 3  \\n· AirPods Pro 3  \\n##### Fiscal Period  \\nThe Company\\'s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is\\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\\'s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which\\noccurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company\\'s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year\\n2023 spanned 53 weeks.  \\n##### Macroeconomic Conditions  \\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and\\ncould in the future materially impact, the Company\\'s results of operations and financial condition.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 21\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### Tariffs and Other Measures  \\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2025, new U.S. Tariffs were announced, including additional tariffs on imports from China,\\nIndia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the EU, among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or\\nthreatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S.\\nTariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs\\nor other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the\\nTrade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing\\nequipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other\\nmeasures that are applied to the Company\\'s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company\\'s supply chain, the\\navailability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains\\nuncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are\\nannounced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the\\noverall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the\\noverall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment\\nfor the Company\\'s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company\\'s business and results of\\noperations.  \\n##### Segment Operating Performance  \\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2025, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Americas</td>\\n<td>$ 178,353</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>$ 167,045</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>$ 162,560</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Europe</td>\\n<td>111,032</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>101,328</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>94,294</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Greater China</td>\\n<td>64,377</td>\\n<td>(4)%</td>\\n<td>66,952</td>\\n<td>(8)%</td>\\n<td>72,559</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Japan</td>\\n<td>28,703</td>\\n<td>15 %</td>\\n<td>25,052</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>24,257</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Rest of Asia Pacific</td>\\n<td>33,696</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>30,658</td>\\n<td>4 %</td>\\n<td>29,615</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>6 %</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>2 %</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n###### Americas  \\nAmericas net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

The markets in which the Company competes are further defined by frequent introduction of\\nnew products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, and rapid adoption of technological\\nadvancements by competitors. Many of the Company\\'s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and\\nvery low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\\'s products and infringing on its intellectual property.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 2\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe Company\\'s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative\\nnew products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for\\nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal\\ncompetitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative\\nprice and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design and technology innovation, a strong third-party software\\nand accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, corporate reputation, and the ability to\\neffectively protect and enforce the Company\\'s intellectual property rights.  \\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables\\nand accessories, and services. The Company\\'s products and services face substantial competition from companies that have\\nsignificant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings\\nwith large customer bases. In addition, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\\'s product\\nfeatures and applications within their products to offer more competitive solutions. The Company also expects competition to\\nintensify as competitors imitate the Company\\'s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work\\ncollaboratively to offer integrated solutions. Some of the Company\\'s competitors have broad product lines, low-priced products,\\nlarge installed bases of active devices, and large customer bases. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have\\naggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to\\nprovide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company has a minority market share in the global\\nsmartphone, personal computer, tablet and wearables markets, and some of the markets in which the Company competes have\\nfrom time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.  \\n##### Supply of Components  \\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\\'s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with\\nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many\\ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide\\nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. Restrictions on international trade can increase the cost or limit the\\navailability of the Company\\'s products and the components and rare earths and other raw materials that go into them.  \\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by\\nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\\' yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have\\nincreased. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, the Company may not be\\nable to extend or renew agreements for the supply of components on similar terms, or at all, and may not be successful in\\nobtaining sufficient quantities from its suppliers or in a timely manner, or in identifying and obtaining sufficient quantities from an\\nalternative source. In addition, component suppliers may fail, be subject to consolidation within a particular industry, or decide to\\nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\\'s requirements,\\nfurther limiting the Company\\'s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\\n\\n[6] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n#### Gross Margin  \\nProducts and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2025, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (dollars in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Gross margin:</td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Products</td>\\n<td>$ 112,887</td>\\n<td>$ 109,633</td>\\n<td>$ 108,803</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Services</td>\\n<td>82,314</td>\\n<td>71,050</td>\\n<td>60,345</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total gross margin</td>\\n<td>$ 195,201</td>\\n<td>$ 180,683</td>\\n<td>$ 169,148</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Gross margin percentage:</td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Products</td>\\n<td>36.8%</td>\\n<td>37.2%</td>\\n<td>36.5%</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Services</td>\\n<td>75.4%</td>\\n<td>73.9%</td>\\n<td>70.8%</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total gross margin percentage</td>\\n<td>46.9%</td>\\n<td>46.2%</td>\\n<td>44.1%</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n##### Products Gross Margin  \\nProducts gross margin increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to favorable costs and a different mix of products,\\npartially offset by tariff costs.  \\nProducts gross margin percentage decreased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to a different mix of products and\\ntariff costs, partially offset by other favorable costs.  \\n##### Services Gross Margin  \\nServices gross margin increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher Services net sales and a different mix of\\nservices.  \\nServices gross margin percentage increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to a different mix of services, partially\\noffset by higher costs.  \\nThe Company\\'s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K\\nunder the heading \"Risk Factors.\" As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and\\ndownward pressure.\\n\\n[7] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n#### Macroeconomic and Industry Risks  \\nThe Company\\'s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and\\nadverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, results of operations, financial\\ncondition and stock price.  \\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\\'s total net sales.\\nIn addition, the Company\\'s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company\\'s supplier facilities, including\\nmanufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company\\'s operations and performance depend\\nsignificantly on global and regional economic conditions.  \\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher\\ninterest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely\\naffect demand for the Company\\'s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially\\nadversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset\\nvalues, and other economic factors.  \\nUncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can also have a significant impact on the Company\\'s\\nsuppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and\\ndevelopers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and\\ninsolvency.  \\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\\'s trade receivables; the\\nfailure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company\\'s ability to issue new debt; reduced\\nliquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company\\'s financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially\\nadversely affect the Company\\'s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 5\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe Company\\'s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical\\ntensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business\\ninterruptions.  \\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health\\nissues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can have a material adverse effect on the Company and its\\ncustomers, employees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other\\nchannel partners.  \\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\\'s total net sales,\\nand the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. A significant majority of the Company\\'s\\nmanufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South\\nKorea, Taiwan and Vietnam, in addition to sourcing from partners and facilities located in the U.S. Restrictions on international\\ntrade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the\\nCompany\\'s business and supply chain. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries\\nand regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations.\\nRestrictive measures can increase the cost or limit the availability of the Company\\'s products and the components and rare\\nearths and other raw materials that go into them. Restrictive measures can also require the Company to change suppliers,\\nrestructure business relationships and operations, refrain from offering and distributing or cease to offer and distribute affected\\nproducts, services and third-party applications to its customers, and increase the prices of its products and services. Changing\\nthe Company\\'s business and supply chain in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be\\nexpensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\\'s business and results of operations. Trade and other international\\ndisputes can also have an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in\\nconsumer spending and negative consumer sentiment for the Company\\'s products and services, all of which can further\\nadversely affect the Company\\'s business and results of operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance\\nnotice, which can create uncertainty, and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate any or all adverse impacts from\\nsuch measures. Global supply chains can be highly concentrated, and an escalation of geopolitical tensions or conflict could\\nresult in significant disruptions. Beginning in the second quarter of 2025, new tariffs were announced on imports to the U.S.\\n(\"U.S. Tariffs\"), including additional tariffs on imports from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the European\\nUnion (\"EU\"), among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or threatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports\\nfrom the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S. Tariffs have been announced and further\\nchanges could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs or other measures. For example, the U.S.\\nDepartment of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended,\\ninto, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products,\\nincluding downstream products that contain semiconductors. The ultimate impact remains uncertain and will depend on several\\nfactors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to what extent\\nother countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the overall magnitude and duration of these\\nmeasures. If disputes and conflicts further escalate, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and\\nrestrictive.  \\nMany of the Company\\'s operations, retail stores and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\\'s suppliers\\nand contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change is\\nresulting in certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. In\\naddition, the Company\\'s and its suppliers\\' operations, retail stores and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire,\\npower shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts,\\nransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company\\'s\\ncontrol.  \\nSuch events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create\\ndelays and inefficiencies in the Company\\'s supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\\'s\\nservice offerings, increase the Company\\'s costs, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas.  \\nThe Company\\'s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While\\nthe Company\\'s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur\\nand could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company\\'s business, and harm to the Company\\'s reputation.\\nMajor public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the\\nfuture materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products;\\nthe imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight\\nservices and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company\\'s operations, supply chain and sales\\nand distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays\\nin production ramps of new products and development of new services.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 6\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nFollowing any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, incur significant expenditures to\\nresume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and\\nmanufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative\\nconsequences to the Company. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance\\ncoverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. Any of the foregoing can materially adversely affect the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\n##### Global markets for the Company\\'s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.  \\nThe Company\\'s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets. These markets are characterized by\\naggressive price competition, downward pressure on gross margins, continual improvement in product performance, and price\\nsensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. These markets are further defined by frequent introduction of new products\\nand services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, and rapid adoption of technological advancements.  \\nThe Company\\'s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative\\nnew products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for\\nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the\\nCompany must make significant investments in R&D. These investments may not achieve expected returns, and the Company\\nmay not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.  \\nThe Company\\'s ability to compete successfully also depends on the effective protection and enforcement of its intellectual\\nproperty rights. Regulatory requirements, government investigations and litigation can force the Company to withdraw from, or\\nmodify its products and services for, certain countries and limit its ability to derive value from, or to enjoin others from using, its\\nintellectual property rights. Additionally, they may require the Company to share its innovations with competitors. Any of these\\noutcomes can have a negative impact on the Company\\'s competitive advantage and materially adversely affect its business,\\nresults of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to\\nregister, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company\\'s competitors seek to compete\\nprimarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\\'s products and infringing on\\nits intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the\\nCompany operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if\\ncompetitors infringe on the Company\\'s intellectual property, the Company\\'s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be\\nmaterially adversely affected.  \\nThe Company\\'s products and services face substantial competition from companies that have significant technical, marketing,\\ndistribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and service offerings. In addition, the Company faces\\nsignificant competition as competitors imitate the Company\\'s product features and applications within their products to offer more\\ncompetitive solutions. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company\\'s approach to\\nproviding components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. Some of the\\nCompany\\'s competitors have broad product lines, low-priced products, large installed bases of active devices, and large\\ncustomer bases. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product\\nmargins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products and services at little or no\\nprofit or even at a loss. The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer, tablet and\\nwearables markets, and some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no\\ngrowth or contracted overall.  \\nIf the Company is unable to compete successfully, its business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock\\nprice can be materially adversely affected.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 7\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n[8] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n## Note 13 - Segment Information and Geographic Data  \\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis.

Financial Risks  \\n##### The Company\\'s net sales and gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors.  \\nThe Company\\'s gross margins vary significantly across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels\\nand can change over time. The Company\\'s net sales and gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a\\nvariety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the\\nCompany may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\\'s ability to effectively stimulate demand\\nfor certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of\\ncomponents, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company\\'s services; the\\nCompany\\'s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the\\ngeographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product\\nand service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; the imposition of new\\nor increased tariffs and other trade restrictions, their overall magnitude and duration, and retaliatory actions in response; and the\\nintroduction of new products or services, including new products or services with lower profit margins. These and other factors\\ncould have a materially adverse impact on the Company\\'s results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Further, the\\nCompany generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product category and a decline in demand for that product\\ncould significantly impact net sales and gross margins.  \\n##### The Company\\'s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.  \\nThe Company\\'s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales, cost\\nof sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company\\'s products in foreign countries and on products that\\ninclude components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be\\nmaterially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.  \\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\\'s foreign\\ncurrency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing\\ndemand for the Company\\'s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to\\nraise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\\'s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross\\nmargins the Company earns on foreign currency-denominated sales.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 15\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\\'s foreign\\ncurrency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its\\nforeign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may\\nincrease the Company\\'s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.  \\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to\\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a\\nportion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are\\nin place.  \\n##### The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.  \\nThe Company\\'s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and\\neconomic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of\\nthe Company\\'s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Although the Company has not\\nrealized significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in\\nsignificant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\\'s results of operations, financial condition and stock\\nprice.  \\n##### The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.  \\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers and other resellers.\\nThe Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and\\ngovernment customers. A substantial majority of the Company\\'s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral,\\nthird-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company\\'s trade\\nreceivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company\\'s exposure to credit and\\ncollectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-\\ntrade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture\\nsubassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with\\nlong-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 27, 2025, the Company\\'s vendor non-\\ntrade receivables were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. If the Company is unable to\\nmonitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, the\\nCompany\\'s results of operations, financial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.  \\n##### The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.  \\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a\\nnumber of the Company\\'s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income\\ntaxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for\\nEconomic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the\\nintroduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company\\'s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings\\nin countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of\\nnew taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant\\njudgment and be subject to differing interpretations.  \\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service\\nand other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome\\nresulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. The outcome of such examinations is\\ninherently uncertain. If the Company\\'s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\\'s\\ntaxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\\'s business, results of operations, financial\\ncondition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 16\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n[2] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n### Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product  \\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\\'s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with\\nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many\\ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide\\nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. Restrictions on international trade can increase the cost or limit the\\navailability of the Company\\'s products and the components and rare earths and other raw materials that go into them.  \\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by\\nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\\' yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have\\nincreased. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, the Company may not be\\nable to extend or renew agreements for the supply of components on similar terms, or at all, and may not be successful in\\nobtaining sufficient quantities from its suppliers or in a timely manner, or in identifying and obtaining sufficient quantities from an\\nalternative source. In addition, component suppliers may fail, be subject to consolidation within a particular industry, or decide to\\nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\\'s requirements,\\nfurther limiting the Company\\'s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.  \\nSubstantially all of the Company\\'s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in\\nChina mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 46\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n[3] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n#### Macroeconomic and Industry Risks  \\nThe Company\\'s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and\\nadverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, results of operations, financial\\ncondition and stock price.  \\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\\'s total net sales.\\nIn addition, the Company\\'s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company\\'s supplier facilities, including\\nmanufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company\\'s operations and performance depend\\nsignificantly on global and regional economic conditions.  \\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher\\ninterest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely\\naffect demand for the Company\\'s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially\\nadversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset\\nvalues, and other economic factors.  \\nUncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can also have a significant impact on the Company\\'s\\nsuppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and\\ndevelopers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and\\ninsolvency.  \\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\\'s trade receivables; the\\nfailure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company\\'s ability to issue new debt; reduced\\nliquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company\\'s financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially\\nadversely affect the Company\\'s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 5\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe Company\\'s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical\\ntensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business\\ninterruptions.  \\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health\\nissues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can have a material adverse effect on the Company and its\\ncustomers, employees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other\\nchannel partners.  \\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\\'s total net sales,\\nand the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. A significant majority of the Company\\'s\\nmanufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South\\nKorea, Taiwan and Vietnam, in addition to sourcing from partners and facilities located in the U.S. Restrictions on international\\ntrade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the\\nCompany\\'s business and supply chain. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries\\nand regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations.\\nRestrictive measures can increase the cost or limit the availability of the Company\\'s products and the components and rare\\nearths and other raw materials that go into them. Restrictive measures can also require the Company to change suppliers,\\nrestructure business relationships and operations, refrain from offering and distributing or cease to offer and distribute affected\\nproducts, services and third-party applications to its customers, and increase the prices of its products and services. Changing\\nthe Company\\'s business and supply chain in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be\\nexpensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\\'s business and results of operations. Trade and other international\\ndisputes can also have an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in\\nconsumer spending and negative consumer sentiment for the Company\\'s products and services, all of which can further\\nadversely affect the Company\\'s business and results of operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance\\nnotice, which can create uncertainty, and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate any or all adverse impacts from\\nsuch measures. Global supply chains can be highly concentrated, and an escalation of geopolitical tensions or conflict could\\nresult in significant disruptions. Beginning in the second quarter of 2025, new tariffs were announced on imports to the U.S.\\n(\"U.S. Tariffs\"), including additional tariffs on imports from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the European\\nUnion (\"EU\"), among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or threatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports\\nfrom the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S. Tariffs have been announced and further\\nchanges could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs or other measures. For example, the U.S.\\nDepartment of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended,\\ninto, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products,\\nincluding downstream products that contain semiconductors. The ultimate impact remains uncertain and will depend on several\\nfactors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to what extent\\nother countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the overall magnitude and duration of these\\nmeasures. If disputes and conflicts further escalate, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and\\nrestrictive.  \\nMany of the Company\\'s operations, retail stores and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\\'s suppliers\\nand contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change is\\nresulting in certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. In\\naddition, the Company\\'s and its suppliers\\' operations, retail stores and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire,\\npower shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts,\\nransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company\\'s\\ncontrol.  \\nSuch events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create\\ndelays and inefficiencies in the Company\\'s supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\\'s\\nservice offerings, increase the Company\\'s costs, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas.  \\nThe Company\\'s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While\\nthe Company\\'s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur\\nand could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company\\'s business, and harm to the Company\\'s reputation.\\nMajor public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the\\nfuture materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products;\\nthe imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight\\nservices and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company\\'s operations, supply chain and sales\\nand distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays\\nin production ramps of new products and development of new services.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 6\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nFollowing any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, incur significant expenditures to\\nresume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and\\nmanufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative\\nconsequences to the Company. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance\\ncoverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. Any of the foregoing can materially adversely affect the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\n##### Global markets for the Company\\'s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.  \\nThe Company\\'s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets. These markets are characterized by\\naggressive price competition, downward pressure on gross margins, continual improvement in product performance, and price\\nsensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. These markets are further defined by frequent introduction of new products\\nand services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, and rapid adoption of technological advancements.  \\nThe Company\\'s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative\\nnew products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for\\nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the\\nCompany must make significant investments in R&D. These investments may not achieve expected returns, and the Company\\nmay not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.  \\nThe Company\\'s ability to compete successfully also depends on the effective protection and enforcement of its intellectual\\nproperty rights. Regulatory requirements, government investigations and litigation can force the Company to withdraw from, or\\nmodify its products and services for, certain countries and limit its ability to derive value from, or to enjoin others from using, its\\nintellectual property rights. Additionally, they may require the Company to share its innovations with competitors. Any of these\\noutcomes can have a negative impact on the Company\\'s competitive advantage and materially adversely affect its business,\\nresults of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to\\nregister, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company\\'s competitors seek to compete\\nprimarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\\'s products and infringing on\\nits intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the\\nCompany operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if\\ncompetitors infringe on the Company\\'s intellectual property, the Company\\'s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be\\nmaterially adversely affected.  \\nThe Company\\'s products and services face substantial competition from companies that have significant technical, marketing,\\ndistribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and service offerings. In addition, the Company faces\\nsignificant competition as competitors imitate the Company\\'s product features and applications within their products to offer more\\ncompetitive solutions. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company\\'s approach to\\nproviding components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. Some of the\\nCompany\\'s competitors have broad product lines, low-priced products, large installed bases of active devices, and large\\ncustomer bases. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product\\nmargins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products and services at little or no\\nprofit or even at a loss. The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer, tablet and\\nwearables markets, and some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no\\ngrowth or contracted overall.  \\nIf the Company is unable to compete successfully, its business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock\\nprice can be materially adversely affected.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 7\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n[4] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n#### Foreign Exchange Rate Risk  \\nThe Company\\'s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other\\nthan the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the\\nCompany\\'s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair\\nvalues of certain of the Company\\'s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use\\nderivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company\\nmay choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or\\nprohibitive cost.  \\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (\"VAR\") model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of\\nfluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair\\nvalue, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\\'s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates.\\nBased on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $590\\nmillion and $538 million as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, respectively. Changes in the Company\\'s underlying\\nforeign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the\\nCompany\\'s foreign currency derivatives.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 27\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n[5] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n#### Competition  \\nThe markets for the Company\\'s products and services are highly competitive and are characterized by aggressive price\\ncompetition, downward pressure on gross margins, continual improvement in product performance, and price sensitivity on the\\npart of consumers and businesses.

In response, several countries have imposed, or\\nthreatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S.\\nTariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs\\nor other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the\\nTrade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing\\nequipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other\\nmeasures that are applied to the Company\\'s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company\\'s supply chain, the\\navailability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains\\nuncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are\\nannounced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the\\noverall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the\\noverall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment\\nfor the Company\\'s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company\\'s business and results of\\noperations.  \\n##### Segment Operating Performance  \\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2025, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Americas</td>\\n<td>$ 178,353</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>$ 167,045</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>$ 162,560</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Europe</td>\\n<td>111,032</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>101,328</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>94,294</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Greater China</td>\\n<td>64,377</td>\\n<td>(4)%</td>\\n<td>66,952</td>\\n<td>(8)%</td>\\n<td>72,559</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Japan</td>\\n<td>28,703</td>\\n<td>15 %</td>\\n<td>25,052</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>24,257</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Rest of Asia Pacific</td>\\n<td>33,696</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>30,658</td>\\n<td>4 %</td>\\n<td>29,615</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>6 %</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>2 %</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n###### Americas  \\nAmericas net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property rights\\nin the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an\\nimportant factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies\\nprimarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.  \\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its\\nhardware, software and service research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of\\napplications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual\\nproperty rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company\\'s products\\nand services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its\\nproducts and services.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 3\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company\\'s products and services include technology or\\nintellectual property that must be licensed from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating\\nto various aspects of the Company\\'s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain\\nsuch licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the\\nfuture on reasonable terms or at all.\\n\\n[2] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n#### Financial Risks  \\n##### The Company\\'s net sales and gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors.  \\nThe Company\\'s gross margins vary significantly across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels\\nand can change over time. The Company\\'s net sales and gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a\\nvariety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the\\nCompany may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\\'s ability to effectively stimulate demand\\nfor certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of\\ncomponents, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company\\'s services; the\\nCompany\\'s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the\\ngeographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product\\nand service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; the imposition of new\\nor increased tariffs and other trade restrictions, their overall magnitude and duration, and retaliatory actions in response; and the\\nintroduction of new products or services, including new products or services with lower profit margins. These and other factors\\ncould have a materially adverse impact on the Company\\'s results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Further, the\\nCompany generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product category and a decline in demand for that product\\ncould significantly impact net sales and gross margins.  \\n##### The Company\\'s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.  \\nThe Company\\'s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales, cost\\nof sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company\\'s products in foreign countries and on products that\\ninclude components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be\\nmaterially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.  \\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\\'s foreign\\ncurrency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing\\ndemand for the Company\\'s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to\\nraise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\\'s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross\\nmargins the Company earns on foreign currency-denominated sales.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 15\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\\'s foreign\\ncurrency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its\\nforeign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may\\nincrease the Company\\'s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.  \\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to\\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a\\nportion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are\\nin place.  \\n##### The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.  \\nThe Company\\'s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and\\neconomic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of\\nthe Company\\'s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Although the Company has not\\nrealized significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in\\nsignificant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\\'s results of operations, financial condition and stock\\nprice.  \\n##### The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.  \\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers and other resellers.\\nThe Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and\\ngovernment customers. A substantial majority of the Company\\'s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral,\\nthird-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company\\'s trade\\nreceivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company\\'s exposure to credit and\\ncollectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-\\ntrade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture\\nsubassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with\\nlong-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 27, 2025, the Company\\'s vendor non-\\ntrade receivables were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. If the Company is unable to\\nmonitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, the\\nCompany\\'s results of operations, financial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.  \\n##### The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.  \\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a\\nnumber of the Company\\'s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income\\ntaxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for\\nEconomic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the\\nintroduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company\\'s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings\\nin countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of\\nnew taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant\\njudgment and be subject to differing interpretations.  \\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service\\nand other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome\\nresulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. The outcome of such examinations is\\ninherently uncertain. If the Company\\'s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\\'s\\ntaxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\\'s business, results of operations, financial\\ncondition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 16\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n[3] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n### Apple Inc.

The Company records a liability when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount is\\nreasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner\\ninconsistent with management\\'s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\\'s financial condition and operating\\nresults.\\n\\n[5] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n#### Macroeconomic and Industry Risks  \\nThe Company\\'s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and\\nadverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\\'s business, results of operations, financial\\ncondition and stock price.  \\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\\'s total net sales.\\nIn addition, the Company\\'s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company\\'s supplier facilities, including\\nmanufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company\\'s operations and performance depend\\nsignificantly on global and regional economic conditions.  \\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher\\ninterest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely\\naffect demand for the Company\\'s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially\\nadversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset\\nvalues, and other economic factors.  \\nUncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can also have a significant impact on the Company\\'s\\nsuppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and\\ndevelopers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and\\ninsolvency.  \\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\\'s trade receivables; the\\nfailure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company\\'s ability to issue new debt; reduced\\nliquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company\\'s financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially\\nadversely affect the Company\\'s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 5\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe Company\\'s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical\\ntensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business\\ninterruptions.  \\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health\\nissues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can have a material adverse effect on the Company and its\\ncustomers, employees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other\\nchannel partners.  \\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\\'s total net sales,\\nand the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. A significant majority of the Company\\'s\\nmanufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South\\nKorea, Taiwan and Vietnam, in addition to sourcing from partners and facilities located in the U.S. Restrictions on international\\ntrade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the\\nCompany\\'s business and supply chain. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries\\nand regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations.\\nRestrictive measures can increase the cost or limit the availability of the Company\\'s products and the components and rare\\nearths and other raw materials that go into them. Restrictive measures can also require the Company to change suppliers,\\nrestructure business relationships and operations, refrain from offering and distributing or cease to offer and distribute affected\\nproducts, services and third-party applications to its customers, and increase the prices of its products and services. Changing\\nthe Company\\'s business and supply chain in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be\\nexpensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\\'s business and results of operations. Trade and other international\\ndisputes can also have an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in\\nconsumer spending and negative consumer sentiment for the Company\\'s products and services, all of which can further\\nadversely affect the Company\\'s business and results of operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance\\nnotice, which can create uncertainty, and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate any or all adverse impacts from\\nsuch measures. Global supply chains can be highly concentrated, and an escalation of geopolitical tensions or conflict could\\nresult in significant disruptions. Beginning in the second quarter of 2025, new tariffs were announced on imports to the U.S.\\n(\"U.S. Tariffs\"), including additional tariffs on imports from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the European\\nUnion (\"EU\"), among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or threatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports\\nfrom the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S. Tariffs have been announced and further\\nchanges could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs or other measures. For example, the U.S.\\nDepartment of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended,\\ninto, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products,\\nincluding downstream products that contain semiconductors. The ultimate impact remains uncertain and will depend on several\\nfactors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to what extent\\nother countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the overall magnitude and duration of these\\nmeasures. If disputes and conflicts further escalate, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and\\nrestrictive.  \\nMany of the Company\\'s operations, retail stores and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\\'s suppliers\\nand contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change is\\nresulting in certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. In\\naddition, the Company\\'s and its suppliers\\' operations, retail stores and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire,\\npower shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts,\\nransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company\\'s\\ncontrol.  \\nSuch events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create\\ndelays and inefficiencies in the Company\\'s supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\\'s\\nservice offerings, increase the Company\\'s costs, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas.  \\nThe Company\\'s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While\\nthe Company\\'s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur\\nand could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company\\'s business, and harm to the Company\\'s reputation.\\nMajor public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the\\nfuture materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products;\\nthe imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight\\nservices and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company\\'s operations, supply chain and sales\\nand distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays\\nin production ramps of new products and development of new services.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 6\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nFollowing any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, incur significant expenditures to\\nresume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and\\nmanufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative\\nconsequences to the Company. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance\\ncoverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. Any of the foregoing can materially adversely affect the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\n##### Global markets for the Company\\'s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.  \\nThe Company\\'s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets. These markets are characterized by\\naggressive price competition, downward pressure on gross margins, continual improvement in product performance, and price\\nsensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. These markets are further defined by frequent introduction of new products\\nand services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, and rapid adoption of technological advancements.  \\nThe Company\\'s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative\\nnew products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for\\nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the\\nCompany must make significant investments in R&D. These investments may not achieve expected returns, and the Company\\nmay not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.  \\nThe Company\\'s ability to compete successfully also depends on the effective protection and enforcement of its intellectual\\nproperty rights. Regulatory requirements, government investigations and litigation can force the Company to withdraw from, or\\nmodify its products and services for, certain countries and limit its ability to derive value from, or to enjoin others from using, its\\nintellectual property rights. Additionally, they may require the Company to share its innovations with competitors. Any of these\\noutcomes can have a negative impact on the Company\\'s competitive advantage and materially adversely affect its business,\\nresults of operations, financial condition and stock price.  \\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to\\nregister, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company\\'s competitors seek to compete\\nprimarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\\'s products and infringing on\\nits intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the\\nCompany operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if\\ncompetitors infringe on the Company\\'s intellectual property, the Company\\'s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be\\nmaterially adversely affected.  \\nThe Company\\'s products and services face substantial competition from companies that have significant technical, marketing,\\ndistribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and service offerings. In addition, the Company faces\\nsignificant competition as competitors imitate the Company\\'s product features and applications within their products to offer more\\ncompetitive solutions. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company\\'s approach to\\nproviding components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. Some of the\\nCompany\\'s competitors have broad product lines, low-priced products, large installed bases of active devices, and large\\ncustomer bases. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product\\nmargins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products and services at little or no\\nprofit or even at a loss. The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer, tablet and\\nwearables markets, and some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no\\ngrowth or contracted overall.  \\nIf the Company is unable to compete successfully, its business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock\\nprice can be materially adversely affected.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 7\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n[6] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n#### Competition  \\nThe markets for the Company\\'s products and services are highly competitive and are characterized by aggressive price\\ncompetition, downward pressure on gross margins, continual improvement in product performance, and price sensitivity on the\\npart of consumers and businesses. The markets in which the Company competes are further defined by frequent introduction of\\nnew products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, and rapid adoption of technological\\nadvancements by competitors. Many of the Company\\'s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and\\nvery low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\\'s products and infringing on its intellectual property.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 2\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe Company\\'s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative\\nnew products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for\\nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal\\ncompetitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative\\nprice and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design and technology innovation, a strong third-party software\\nand accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, corporate reputation, and the ability to\\neffectively protect and enforce the Company\\'s intellectual property rights.  \\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables\\nand accessories, and services. The Company\\'s products and services face substantial competition from companies that have\\nsignificant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings\\nwith large customer bases. In addition, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\\'s product\\nfeatures and applications within their products to offer more competitive solutions. The Company also expects competition to\\nintensify as competitors imitate the Company\\'s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work\\ncollaboratively to offer integrated solutions. Some of the Company\\'s competitors have broad product lines, low-priced products,\\nlarge installed bases of active devices, and large customer bases. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have\\naggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to\\nprovide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company has a minority market share in the global\\nsmartphone, personal computer, tablet and wearables markets, and some of the markets in which the Company competes have\\nfrom time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.  \\n##### Supply of Components  \\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\\'s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with\\nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many\\ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide\\nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. Restrictions on international trade can increase the cost or limit the\\navailability of the Company\\'s products and the components and rare earths and other raw materials that go into them.  \\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by\\nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\\' yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have\\nincreased. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, the Company may not be\\nable to extend or renew agreements for the supply of components on similar terms, or at all, and may not be successful in\\nobtaining sufficient quantities from its suppliers or in a timely manner, or in identifying and obtaining sufficient quantities from an\\nalternative source. In addition, component suppliers may fail, be subject to consolidation within a particular industry, or decide to\\nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\\'s requirements,\\nfurther limiting the Company\\'s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\\n\\n[7] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n### Item 3. Legal Proceedings  \\n#### Digital Markets Act Investigations  \\nOn March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened a formal noncompliance investigation against the Company\\nunder Article 5(4) of the EU DMA (\"Article 5(4) Investigation\"). The Article 5(4) Investigation relates to how developers may\\ncommunicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store, as well as how developers may\\nconclude contracts with those end users. On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened an additional formal\\ninvestigation against the Company regarding whether the Company\\'s new contractual requirements for third-party app\\ndevelopers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA (\"Article 6(4) Investigation\"). On April 23, 2025, the Commission fined the\\nCompany €500 million in the Article 5(4) Investigation and issued a cease and desist order requiring the Company to remove\\ntechnical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to alternative distribution channels outside the\\nApp Store. The Company has appealed the Commission\\'s Article 5(4) decision. Also on April 23, 2025, the Commission issued\\npreliminary findings in the Article 6(4) Investigation. If the Commission makes a final determination in the Article 6(4)\\nInvestigation that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the\\nCompany\\'s annual worldwide net sales. The Commission may also seek to impose additional fines if it deems that the Company\\nhas violated a cease and desist order. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes\\nto its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.\\n\\n[8] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n#### Available Information  \\nThe Company\\'s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and\\namendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\\n(\"Exchange Act\"), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\").

Significant\\nannouncements during fiscal year 2025 included the following:  \\nFirst Quarter 2025:  \\n· MacBook Pro  \\n· Mac mini  \\n· iMac  \\n· iPad mini  \\nSecond Quarter 2025:  \\n· iPhone 16e  \\n· iPad Air  \\n· iPad  \\n· MacBook Air  \\n· Mac Studio  \\nThird Quarter 2025:  \\n· iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, iPadOS 26, watchOS 26, visionOS 26 and tvOS 26  \\n##### Fourth Quarter 2025:  \\n. iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max  \\n. Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3 and Apple Watch Ultra 3  \\n· AirPods Pro 3  \\n##### Fiscal Period  \\nThe Company\\'s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is\\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\\'s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which\\noccurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company\\'s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year\\n2023 spanned 53 weeks.  \\n##### Macroeconomic Conditions  \\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and\\ncould in the future materially impact, the Company\\'s results of operations and financial condition.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 21\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### Tariffs and Other Measures  \\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2025, new U.S. Tariffs were announced, including additional tariffs on imports from China,\\nIndia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the EU, among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or\\nthreatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S.\\nTariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs\\nor other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the\\nTrade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing\\nequipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other\\nmeasures that are applied to the Company\\'s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company\\'s supply chain, the\\navailability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains\\nuncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are\\nannounced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the\\noverall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the\\noverall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment\\nfor the Company\\'s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company\\'s business and results of\\noperations.  \\n##### Segment Operating Performance  \\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2025, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Americas</td>\\n<td>$ 178,353</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>$ 167,045</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>$ 162,560</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Europe</td>\\n<td>111,032</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>101,328</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>94,294</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Greater China</td>\\n<td>64,377</td>\\n<td>(4)%</td>\\n<td>66,952</td>\\n<td>(8)%</td>\\n<td>72,559</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Japan</td>\\n<td>28,703</td>\\n<td>15 %</td>\\n<td>25,052</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>24,257</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Rest of Asia Pacific</td>\\n<td>33,696</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>30,658</td>\\n<td>4 %</td>\\n<td>29,615</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>6 %</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>2 %</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n###### Americas  \\nAmericas net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the\\nsignificant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company\\'s\\nProducts net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company\\'s Services net sales, control transfers over\\ntime as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer\\nof control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.  \\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer\\nincentive programs based on the Company\\'s expectations and historical experience.  \\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the\\nCompany allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\"SSPs\").\\nWhen available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are\\nestablished that reflect the Company\\'s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they\\nwere sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\\'s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers\\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation\\nincluding, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings,\\nproduct-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.  \\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac\\nand iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the\\nhardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive\\ncertain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any\\nrelated discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable\\nprices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\\'s estimated SSPs. Revenue\\nallocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which\\ngenerally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized\\non a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.  \\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For\\nthese arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that\\nany unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized\\nrevenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.  \\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the\\nCompany recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when\\ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product,\\nretains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party\\napplications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the\\ncustomer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application-related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services\\nnet sales only the commission it retains.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 35\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe following table shows disaggregated net sales, as well as the portion of total net sales that was previously deferred, for\\n2025, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>iPhone</td>\\n<td>$ 209,586</td>\\n<td>$ 201,183</td>\\n<td>$ 200,583</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Mac</td>\\n<td>33,708</td>\\n<td>29,984</td>\\n<td>29,357</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>iPad</td>\\n<td>28,023</td>\\n<td>26,694</td>\\n<td>28,300</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Wearables, Home and Accessories</td>\\n<td>35,686</td>\\n<td>37,005</td>\\n<td>39,845</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Services (1)</td>\\n<td>109,158</td>\\n<td>96,169</td>\\n<td>85,200</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Portion of total net sales that was included in deferred revenue as of the beginning of the period</td>\\n<td>$ 8,229</td>\\n<td>$ 7,728</td>\\n<td>$ 8,169</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n(1) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.  \\nThe Company\\'s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment\\nin Note 13, \"Segment Information and Geographic Data\" for 2025, 2024 and 2023, except in Greater China, where iPhone\\nrevenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.  \\nAs of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the Company had total deferred revenue of $13.7 billion and $12.8 billion,\\nrespectively.

Therefore, many\\ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide\\nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.

The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, the Company may not be\\nable to extend or renew agreements for the supply of components on similar terms, or at all, and may not be successful in\\nobtaining sufficient quantities from its suppliers or in a timely manner, or in identifying and obtaining sufficient quantities from an\\nalternative source.

The markets in which the Company competes are further defined by frequent introduction of\\nnew products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, and rapid adoption of technological\\nadvancements by competitors. Many of the Company\\'s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and\\nvery low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\\'s products and infringing on its intellectual property.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 2\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe Company\\'s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative\\nnew products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for\\nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal\\ncompetitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative\\nprice and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design and technology innovation, a strong third-party software\\nand accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, corporate reputation, and the ability to\\neffectively protect and enforce the Company\\'s intellectual property rights.  \\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables\\nand accessories, and services. The Company\\'s products and services face substantial competition from companies that have\\nsignificant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings\\nwith large customer bases. In addition, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\\'s product\\nfeatures and applications within their products to offer more competitive solutions. The Company also expects competition to\\nintensify as competitors imitate the Company\\'s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work\\ncollaboratively to offer integrated solutions. Some of the Company\\'s competitors have broad product lines, low-priced products,\\nlarge installed bases of active devices, and large customer bases. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have\\naggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to\\nprovide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company has a minority market share in the global\\nsmartphone, personal computer, tablet and wearables markets, and some of the markets in which the Company competes have\\nfrom time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.  \\n##### Supply of Components  \\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\\'s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with\\nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many\\ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide\\nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.

Significant\\nannouncements during fiscal year 2025 included the following:  \\nFirst Quarter 2025:  \\n· MacBook Pro  \\n· Mac mini  \\n· iMac  \\n· iPad mini  \\nSecond Quarter 2025:  \\n· iPhone 16e  \\n· iPad Air  \\n· iPad  \\n· MacBook Air  \\n· Mac Studio  \\nThird Quarter 2025:  \\n· iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, iPadOS 26, watchOS 26, visionOS 26 and tvOS 26  \\n##### Fourth Quarter 2025:  \\n. iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max  \\n. Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3 and Apple Watch Ultra 3  \\n· AirPods Pro 3  \\n##### Fiscal Period  \\nThe Company\\'s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is\\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\\'s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which\\noccurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company\\'s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year\\n2023 spanned 53 weeks.  \\n##### Macroeconomic Conditions  \\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and\\ncould in the future materially impact, the Company\\'s results of operations and financial condition.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 21\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### Tariffs and Other Measures  \\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2025, new U.S. Tariffs were announced, including additional tariffs on imports from China,\\nIndia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the EU, among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or\\nthreatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S.\\nTariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs\\nor other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the\\nTrade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing\\nequipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other\\nmeasures that are applied to the Company\\'s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company\\'s supply chain, the\\navailability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains\\nuncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are\\nannounced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the\\noverall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the\\noverall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment\\nfor the Company\\'s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company\\'s business and results of\\noperations.  \\n##### Segment Operating Performance  \\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2025, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Americas</td>\\n<td>$ 178,353</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>$ 167,045</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>$ 162,560</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Europe</td>\\n<td>111,032</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>101,328</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>94,294</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Greater China</td>\\n<td>64,377</td>\\n<td>(4)%</td>\\n<td>66,952</td>\\n<td>(8)%</td>\\n<td>72,559</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Japan</td>\\n<td>28,703</td>\\n<td>15 %</td>\\n<td>25,052</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>24,257</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Rest of Asia Pacific</td>\\n<td>33,696</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>30,658</td>\\n<td>4 %</td>\\n<td>29,615</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>6 %</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>2 %</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n###### Americas  \\nAmericas net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

The Company\\'s net sales and gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a\\nvariety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the\\nCompany may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\\'s ability to effectively stimulate demand\\nfor certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of\\ncomponents, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company\\'s services; the\\nCompany\\'s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the\\ngeographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product\\nand service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; the imposition of new\\nor increased tariffs and other trade restrictions, their overall magnitude and duration, and retaliatory actions in response; and the\\nintroduction of new products or services, including new products or services with lower profit margins. These and other factors\\ncould have a materially adverse impact on the Company\\'s results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Further, the\\nCompany generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product category and a decline in demand for that product\\ncould significantly impact net sales and gross margins.  \\n##### The Company\\'s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.  \\nThe Company\\'s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales, cost\\nof sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company\\'s products in foreign countries and on products that\\ninclude components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be\\nmaterially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.  \\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\\'s foreign\\ncurrency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing\\ndemand for the Company\\'s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to\\nraise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\\'s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross\\nmargins the Company earns on foreign currency-denominated sales.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 15\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\\'s foreign\\ncurrency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its\\nforeign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may\\nincrease the Company\\'s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.  \\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to\\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a\\nportion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are\\nin place.  \\n##### The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.  \\nThe Company\\'s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and\\neconomic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of\\nthe Company\\'s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Although the Company has not\\nrealized significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in\\nsignificant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\\'s results of operations, financial condition and stock\\nprice.  \\n##### The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.  \\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers and other resellers.\\nThe Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and\\ngovernment customers. A substantial majority of the Company\\'s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral,\\nthird-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company\\'s trade\\nreceivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company\\'s exposure to credit and\\ncollectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-\\ntrade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture\\nsubassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with\\nlong-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 27, 2025, the Company\\'s vendor non-\\ntrade receivables were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. If the Company is unable to\\nmonitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, the\\nCompany\\'s results of operations, financial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.  \\n##### The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.  \\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a\\nnumber of the Company\\'s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income\\ntaxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for\\nEconomic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the\\nintroduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company\\'s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings\\nin countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of\\nnew taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant\\njudgment and be subject to differing interpretations.  \\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service\\nand other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome\\nresulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. The outcome of such examinations is\\ninherently uncertain. If the Company\\'s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\\'s\\ntaxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\\'s business, results of operations, financial\\ncondition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 16\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n[5] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n### Note 2 - Revenue  \\nThe Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of products or services is\\ntransferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the\\nsignificant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company\\'s\\nProducts net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company\\'s Services net sales, control transfers over\\ntime as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer\\nof control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.  \\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer\\nincentive programs based on the Company\\'s expectations and historical experience.  \\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the\\nCompany allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\"SSPs\").\\nWhen available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are\\nestablished that reflect the Company\\'s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they\\nwere sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\\'s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers\\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation\\nincluding, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings,\\nproduct-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.  \\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac\\nand iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the\\nhardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive\\ncertain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any\\nrelated discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable\\nprices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\\'s estimated SSPs. Revenue\\nallocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which\\ngenerally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized\\non a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.  \\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For\\nthese arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that\\nany unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized\\nrevenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.  \\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the\\nCompany recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when\\ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product,\\nretains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party\\napplications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the\\ncustomer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application-related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services\\nnet sales only the commission it retains.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 35\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe following table shows disaggregated net sales, as well as the portion of total net sales that was previously deferred, for\\n2025, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>iPhone</td>\\n<td>$ 209,586</td>\\n<td>$ 201,183</td>\\n<td>$ 200,583</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Mac</td>\\n<td>33,708</td>\\n<td>29,984</td>\\n<td>29,357</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>iPad</td>\\n<td>28,023</td>\\n<td>26,694</td>\\n<td>28,300</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Wearables, Home and Accessories</td>\\n<td>35,686</td>\\n<td>37,005</td>\\n<td>39,845</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Services (1)</td>\\n<td>109,158</td>\\n<td>96,169</td>\\n<td>85,200</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Portion of total net sales that was included in deferred revenue as of the beginning of the period</td>\\n<td>$ 8,229</td>\\n<td>$ 7,728</td>\\n<td>$ 8,169</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n(1) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.  \\nThe Company\\'s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment\\nin Note 13, \"Segment Information and Geographic Data\" for 2025, 2024 and 2023, except in Greater China, where iPhone\\nrevenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.  \\nAs of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the Company had total deferred revenue of $13.7 billion and $12.8 billion,\\nrespectively.

Significant\\nannouncements during fiscal year 2025 included the following:  \\nFirst Quarter 2025:  \\n· MacBook Pro  \\n· Mac mini  \\n· iMac  \\n· iPad mini  \\nSecond Quarter 2025:  \\n· iPhone 16e  \\n· iPad Air  \\n· iPad  \\n· MacBook Air  \\n· Mac Studio  \\nThird Quarter 2025:  \\n· iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, iPadOS 26, watchOS 26, visionOS 26 and tvOS 26  \\n##### Fourth Quarter 2025:  \\n. iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max  \\n. Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3 and Apple Watch Ultra 3  \\n· AirPods Pro 3  \\n##### Fiscal Period  \\nThe Company\\'s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is\\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\\'s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which\\noccurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company\\'s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year\\n2023 spanned 53 weeks.  \\n##### Macroeconomic Conditions  \\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and\\ncould in the future materially impact, the Company\\'s results of operations and financial condition.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 21\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### Tariffs and Other Measures  \\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2025, new U.S. Tariffs were announced, including additional tariffs on imports from China,\\nIndia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the EU, among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or\\nthreatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S.\\nTariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs\\nor other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the\\nTrade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing\\nequipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other\\nmeasures that are applied to the Company\\'s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company\\'s supply chain, the\\navailability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains\\nuncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are\\nannounced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the\\noverall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the\\noverall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment\\nfor the Company\\'s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company\\'s business and results of\\noperations.  \\n##### Segment Operating Performance  \\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2025, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Americas</td>\\n<td>$ 178,353</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>$ 167,045</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>$ 162,560</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Europe</td>\\n<td>111,032</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>101,328</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>94,294</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Greater China</td>\\n<td>64,377</td>\\n<td>(4)%</td>\\n<td>66,952</td>\\n<td>(8)%</td>\\n<td>72,559</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Japan</td>\\n<td>28,703</td>\\n<td>15 %</td>\\n<td>25,052</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>24,257</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Rest of Asia Pacific</td>\\n<td>33,696</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>30,658</td>\\n<td>4 %</td>\\n<td>29,615</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>6 %</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>2 %</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n###### Americas  \\nAmericas net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone and Services.

Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the\\nsignificant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company\\'s\\nProducts net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company\\'s Services net sales, control transfers over\\ntime as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer\\nof control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.  \\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer\\nincentive programs based on the Company\\'s expectations and historical experience.  \\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the\\nCompany allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\"SSPs\").\\nWhen available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are\\nestablished that reflect the Company\\'s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they\\nwere sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\\'s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers\\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation\\nincluding, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings,\\nproduct-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.  \\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac\\nand iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the\\nhardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive\\ncertain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any\\nrelated discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable\\nprices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\\'s estimated SSPs. Revenue\\nallocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which\\ngenerally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized\\non a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.  \\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For\\nthese arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that\\nany unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized\\nrevenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.  \\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the\\nCompany recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when\\ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product,\\nretains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party\\napplications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the\\ncustomer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application-related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services\\nnet sales only the commission it retains.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 35\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nThe following table shows disaggregated net sales, as well as the portion of total net sales that was previously deferred, for\\n2025, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>iPhone</td>\\n<td>$ 209,586</td>\\n<td>$ 201,183</td>\\n<td>$ 200,583</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Mac</td>\\n<td>33,708</td>\\n<td>29,984</td>\\n<td>29,357</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>iPad</td>\\n<td>28,023</td>\\n<td>26,694</td>\\n<td>28,300</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Wearables, Home and Accessories</td>\\n<td>35,686</td>\\n<td>37,005</td>\\n<td>39,845</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Services (1)</td>\\n<td>109,158</td>\\n<td>96,169</td>\\n<td>85,200</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Portion of total net sales that was included in deferred revenue as of the beginning of the period</td>\\n<td>$ 8,229</td>\\n<td>$ 7,728</td>\\n<td>$ 8,169</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n(1) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.  \\nThe Company\\'s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment\\nin Note 13, \"Segment Information and Geographic Data\" for 2025, 2024 and 2023, except in Greater China, where iPhone\\nrevenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.  \\nAs of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the Company had total deferred revenue of $13.7 billion and $12.8 billion,\\nrespectively.

Americas\\nincludes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa.\\nGreater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia, New Zealand and those\\nAsian countries not included in the Company\\'s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar\\nhardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the\\nCompany\\'s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.  \\nThe CODM uses segment net sales and operating income information to make certain decisions, such as product and service\\npricing, and to decide how to allocate resources related to sales activities and marketing investments. Net sales for geographic\\nsegments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company\\'s retail stores located in those\\ngeographic locations. Operating income for each segment consists of net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and\\noperating expenses directly attributable to the segment. The information provided to the CODM for purposes of making decisions\\nand assessing segment performance excludes asset information.  \\nThe following tables show information by reportable segment for 2025, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th rowspan=\"2\"></th>\\n<th colspan=\"7\">2025</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Americas</th>\\n<th>Europe</th>\\n<th>Greater

Significant\\nannouncements during fiscal year 2025 included the following:  \\nFirst Quarter 2025:  \\n· MacBook Pro  \\n· Mac mini  \\n· iMac  \\n· iPad mini  \\nSecond Quarter 2025:  \\n· iPhone 16e  \\n· iPad Air  \\n· iPad  \\n· MacBook Air  \\n· Mac Studio  \\nThird Quarter 2025:  \\n· iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, iPadOS 26, watchOS 26, visionOS 26 and tvOS 26  \\n##### Fourth Quarter 2025:  \\n. iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max  \\n. Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3 and Apple Watch Ultra 3  \\n· AirPods Pro 3  \\n##### Fiscal Period  \\nThe Company\\'s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is\\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\\'s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which\\noccurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company\\'s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year\\n2023 spanned 53 weeks.  \\n##### Macroeconomic Conditions  \\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and\\ncould in the future materially impact, the Company\\'s results of operations and financial condition.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 21\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n##### Tariffs and Other Measures  \\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2025, new U.S. Tariffs were announced, including additional tariffs on imports from China,\\nIndia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the EU, among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or\\nthreatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S.\\nTariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs\\nor other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the\\nTrade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing\\nequipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other\\nmeasures that are applied to the Company\\'s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the\\nCompany\\'s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company\\'s supply chain, the\\navailability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains\\nuncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are\\nannounced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the\\noverall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the\\noverall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment\\nfor the Company\\'s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company\\'s business and results of\\noperations.  \\n##### Segment Operating Performance  \\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2025, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th></th>\\n<th>2025</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2024</th>\\n<th>Change</th>\\n<th>2023</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Americas</td>\\n<td>$ 178,353</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>$ 167,045</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>$ 162,560</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Europe</td>\\n<td>111,032</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>101,328</td>\\n<td>7 %</td>\\n<td>94,294</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Greater China</td>\\n<td>64,377</td>\\n<td>(4)%</td>\\n<td>66,952</td>\\n<td>(8)%</td>\\n<td>72,559</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Japan</td>\\n<td>28,703</td>\\n<td>15 %</td>\\n<td>25,052</td>\\n<td>3 %</td>\\n<td>24,257</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Rest of Asia Pacific</td>\\n<td>33,696</td>\\n<td>10 %</td>\\n<td>30,658</td>\\n<td>4 %</td>\\n<td>29,615</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Total net sales</td>\\n<td>$ 416,161</td>\\n<td>6 %</td>\\n<td>$ 391,035</td>\\n<td>2 %</td>\\n<td>$ 383,285</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n###### Americas  \\nAmericas net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone and Services. The\\nweakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable year-over-year impact on Americas net sales during\\n2025.  \\n###### Europe  \\nEurope net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of Services, iPhone and Mac.  \\n###### Greater China  \\nGreater China net sales decreased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to lower net sales of iPhone, partially offset by\\nhigher net sales of Mac.  \\n###### Japan  \\nJapan net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone, Services and iPad.  \\n###### Rest of Asia Pacific  \\nRest of Asia Pacific net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone, Services and\\nMac.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 22\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n[3] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n#### Financial Risks  \\n##### The Company\\'s net sales and gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors.  \\nThe Company\\'s gross margins vary significantly across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels\\nand can change over time. The Company\\'s net sales and gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a\\nvariety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the\\nCompany may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\\'s ability to effectively stimulate demand\\nfor certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of\\ncomponents, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company\\'s services; the\\nCompany\\'s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the\\ngeographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product\\nand service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; the imposition of new\\nor increased tariffs and other trade restrictions, their overall magnitude and duration, and retaliatory actions in response; and the\\nintroduction of new products or services, including new products or services with lower profit margins. These and other factors\\ncould have a materially adverse impact on the Company\\'s results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Further, the\\nCompany generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product category and a decline in demand for that product\\ncould significantly impact net sales and gross margins.  \\n##### The Company\\'s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.  \\nThe Company\\'s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales, cost\\nof sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company\\'s products in foreign countries and on products that\\ninclude components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be\\nmaterially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.  \\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\\'s foreign\\ncurrency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing\\ndemand for the Company\\'s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to\\nraise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\\'s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross\\nmargins the Company earns on foreign currency-denominated sales.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 15\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\\'s foreign\\ncurrency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its\\nforeign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may\\nincrease the Company\\'s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.  \\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to\\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a\\nportion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are\\nin place.  \\n##### The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.  \\nThe Company\\'s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and\\neconomic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of\\nthe Company\\'s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Although the Company has not\\nrealized significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in\\nsignificant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\\'s results of operations, financial condition and stock\\nprice.  \\n##### The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.  \\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers and other resellers.\\nThe Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and\\ngovernment customers. A substantial majority of the Company\\'s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral,\\nthird-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company\\'s trade\\nreceivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company\\'s exposure to credit and\\ncollectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-\\ntrade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture\\nsubassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with\\nlong-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 27, 2025, the Company\\'s vendor non-\\ntrade receivables were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. If the Company is unable to\\nmonitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, the\\nCompany\\'s results of operations, financial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.  \\n##### The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.  \\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a\\nnumber of the Company\\'s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income\\ntaxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for\\nEconomic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the\\nintroduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company\\'s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings\\nin countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of\\nnew taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant\\njudgment and be subject to differing interpretations.  \\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service\\nand other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome\\nresulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. The outcome of such examinations is\\ninherently uncertain. If the Company\\'s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\\'s\\ntaxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\\'s business, results of operations, financial\\ncondition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 16\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n[4] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n#### Foreign Exchange Rate Risk  \\nThe Company\\'s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other\\nthan the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the\\nCompany\\'s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair\\nvalues of certain of the Company\\'s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use\\nderivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company\\nmay choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or\\nprohibitive cost.  \\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (\"VAR\") model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of\\nfluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair\\nvalue, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\\'s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates.\\nBased on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $590\\nmillion and $538 million as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, respectively. Changes in the Company\\'s underlying\\nforeign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the\\nCompany\\'s foreign currency derivatives.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 27\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->\\n\\n[5] company=APPLE year=2025 doc_type=annual_report\\n# Apple Inc.

There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a\\nportion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.  \\nAll derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting treatment for derivative\\ngains and losses is based on intended use and hedge designation.  \\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of cash flow hedge effectiveness are initially deferred\\nin accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction\\naffects earnings, and in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Gains and losses arising from amounts\\nthat are included in the assessment of fair value hedge effectiveness are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of\\nOperations line item to which the hedge relates along with offsetting losses and gains related to the change in value of the\\nhedged item.  \\nFor derivative instruments designated as cash flow and fair value hedges, amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge\\neffectiveness are recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line\\nitem to which the hedge relates. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are\\nrecognized in other comprehensive income/(loss).  \\nGains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges\\nare recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  \\nThe Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash\\nFlows as the items being hedged, which are generally classified as operating activities.  \\n##### Foreign Exchange Rate Risk  \\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other\\ninstruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its\\nforecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.  \\nTo protect the Company\\'s foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign\\nexchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these\\ninstruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 27, 2025, the maximum length of time over which the\\nCompany is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt-related foreign currency transactions is 17\\nyears.  \\nThe Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from\\ncertain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by\\nthe remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.  \\n##### Interest Rate Risk  \\nTo protect the Company\\'s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest\\nrate swaps, options or other instruments.

Apple notes tariffs can materially impact **supply chain, component availability, pricing and gross margin**, and the ultimate impact is uncertain.  \\n- **Macroeconomic sensitivity**: Inflation, higher interest rates, currency fluctuations, and weaker consumer confidence/spending can materially affect demand; Apple also flags knock-on risks to suppliers/partners and financial markets.  \\n- **Supply chain concentration & component constraints**: Certain components are sourced from **single/limited sources** and can face industry-wide shortages/price swings; substantially all hardware is manufactured by outsourcing partners primarily in **China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam**.  \\n- **Concentration in iPhone**: Apple notes it generates a significant portion of net sales from a **single product category**, so a demand decline could significantly impact net sales and gross margins (FY2025 iPhone net sales **$209.6B**, +4% YoY).  \\n- **Regulatory / legal (EU DMA)**: The EU opened DMA noncompliance investigations; in April 2025 the Commission **fined Apple €500M** (Article 5(4)) with a cease-and-desist order (Apple appealed). The Article 6(4) investigation could lead to fines **up to 10% of annual worldwide net sales** if a violation is found.\\n\\n## 6-month fundamental outlook (base case)\\n- **Supportive factors**: Momentum in **Services** (high-margin, +14% YoY in FY2025) and continued **capital returns** provide earnings/FCF resilience.

It has mostly stayed **below 70** (no sustained overbought) and is currently around the **mid‑40s to ~50**, indicating **neutral to slightly weak** momentum.\\n- **Near-term signals:** With **RSI near 50 and MACD flattening**, the setup suggests **indecision**. A **break above the recent swing highs (~272–276 area)** would favor a renewed bullish leg; failure and a **drop back toward ~260** would increase odds of a **MACD bearish crossover** and a deeper pullback.', 'latest_values': {'close': 264.17999267578125, 'rsi_14': 48.161530048248956, 'macd': 0.9736657977634877, 'macd_signal': 0.6789371710061916, 'macd_hist': 0.29472862675729616}}, fundamental={'mode': 'qa', 'company': 'APPLE', 'answer': '## Key strengths\\n- **Scale + profitability**: FY2025 net sales **$416.2B** (+6% YoY) and net income **$112.0B** (vs. $93.7B in FY2024). Total gross margin **46.9%**; **Services gross margin 75.4%** (vs. 73.9% in FY2024).  \\n- **Services growth engine**: Services net sales **$109.2B** (+14% YoY), driven by **advertising, App Store, and cloud services**.  \\n- **Integrated product ecosystem / differentiation**: Apple emphasizes designing “nearly the entire solution” (hardware + OS + apps + services). Competitive factors include **security features**, quality/reliability, innovation, and a **strong third‑party software and accessories ecosystem**.  \\n- **Capital return + liquidity**: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled **$132.4B** (Sep 27, 2025). In FY2025 Apple repurchased **$89.3B** of stock and paid **$15.4B** in dividends; a new **$100B** repurchase authorization was announced in May 2025.\\n\\n## Key risks\\n- **Tariffs / trade restrictions / geopolitics**: New U.S. tariffs announced beginning Q2 FY2025 (including imports from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, EU). Apple notes tariffs can materially impact **supply chain, component availability, pricing and gross margin**, and the ultimate impact is uncertain.  \\n- **Macroeconomic sensitivity**: Inflation, higher interest rates, currency fluctuations, and weaker consumer confidence/spending can materially affect demand; Apple also flags knock-on risks to suppliers/partners and financial markets.  \\n- **Supply chain concentration & component constraints**: Certain components are sourced from **single/limited sources** and can face industry-wide shortages/price swings; substantially all hardware is manufactured by outsourcing partners primarily in **China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam**.  \\n- **Concentration in iPhone**: Apple notes it generates a significant portion of net sales from a **single product category**, so a demand decline could significantly impact net sales and gross margins (FY2025 iPhone net sales **$209.6B**, +4% YoY).  \\n- **Regulatory / legal (EU DMA)**: The EU opened DMA noncompliance investigations; in April 2025 the Commission **fined Apple €500M** (Article 5(4)) with a cease-and-desist order (Apple appealed). The Article 6(4) investigation could lead to fines **up to 10% of annual worldwide net sales** if a violation is found.\\n\\n## 6-month fundamental outlook (base case)\\n- **Supportive factors**: Momentum in **Services** (high-margin, +14% YoY in FY2025) and continued **capital returns** provide earnings/FCF resilience. Product mix has helped (iPhone growth attributed to **higher Pro model sales**), and total gross margin improved YoY (46.9% vs. 46.2%).  \\n- **Watch items / swing factors**: Near-term results are most sensitive to (1) **tariff implementation/retaliation** and pass-through ability (margin risk), (2) **FX** (Apple highlights USD strength can pressure reported sales/margins), (3) **Greater China demand** (FY2025 segment net sales **-4% YoY**, driven primarily by lower iPhone sales), and (4) any **DMA-driven changes** to App Store economics/terms.  \\n- **Net view (6 months)**: Fundamentals look **stable-to-moderately positive** if Services growth persists and product demand holds, but the risk distribution is **skewed by policy/regulatory and trade/tariff uncertainty**, which Apple explicitly flags as potentially material to supply chain and gross margin.\\n\\n*Note: Apple does not provide traditional forward revenue/earnings guidance in the retrieved FY2025 10‑K excerpts; the outlook above is based on disclosed business trends and risk factors in that filing.*', 'sources': [{'company': 'APPLE', 'year': '2025', 'doc_type': 'annual_report', 'source_path': 'c:\\\\Users\\\\rushi\\\\OneDrive -

[...] The timing is further noteworthy: Apple is not always first to adopt and integrate emerging technologies — it typically researches, develops and aims to perfect new tech for years before including it in new products — but the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI is perhaps expediting the company’s need to have a smartphone with the latest buzzy technology.\\n\\n“Apple needed to deliver an AI story and Apple Intelligence should help placate nervous investors and reassure them that Apple is keeping pace with its rivals,” Wood added. “The partnership with ChatGPT is a major development which beefs up Apple’s AI offerings, and new features like a significantly improved Siri will be welcome to users.” [...] The move to invite Altman to the announcement but not have him appear before the public also represents in some ways how Apple is cautiously moving forward with the partnership. OpenAI, along with other AI companies, continues to face concerns from researchers, industry experts and government officials around misinformation, biases, copyright, privacy and security, and more. The deal also comes at a time when the industry is moving quickly, and government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to engage withthe technology responsibly.',\n",

The iPhone is likely to maintain its technological superiority amid intensifying competition with Chinese rivals. Pamir observes that US high-tech firms like Apple will face ongoing risks from central government efforts to achieve political objectives in the Chinese economy. Navigating US-China geopolitical tensions is increasingly a requisite for effectively managing China market risks. [...] On 5 March Counterpoint Research, a global tech market research firm, reported that iPhone sales in China dropped 24% in the first six weeks of 2024, reducing iPhone’s China market share from 19% at the end of 2023 to 15.7%. The decline in iPhone sales occurred when China’s overall cellphone sales dropped 7%, affecting all foreign and domestic brands.\\n\\nIndustry experts point out that iPhone’s overall market position remains strong and Chinese consumers continue to be drawn to iPhone’s brand name, technology, and performance.',\n",

But it has also left Apple — and by extension, every one of its customers — dangerously exposed to a single geopolitical flashpoint, according to The New York Times in its new report, “The Looming Taiwan Chip Disaster That Silicon Valley Has Long Ignored.” [...] TSMC has now agreed to build at least 10 factories in Arizona, and Taiwanese semiconductor companies have committed to investing an additional $150 billion in the United States. Plus, the United States is on track to spend $200 billion on chip plants through 2030, which would increase domestic production capacity by 50%.\\n\\nThose are real numbers, but in a sobering context. Even with all that investment, the U.S. would still account for only around 10% of global semiconductor production by 2030. That’s roughly the same share it held in 2020 when these alarm bells started ringing.\\n\\n### The road ahead\\n\\nTSMC chip wafer [...] # Why Apple users should care about a ‘looming Taiwan chip disaster’\\n\\nBy David Snow • 8:00 am, February 24, 2026\\n\\nTSMC chip\\n\\nNearly every high-end chip powering Apple devices is manufactured in Taiwan, a small island democracy over which China claims ownership. U.S. officials have warned Apple and the rest of Silicon Valley for years that a Chinese blockade, invasion or prolonged military standoff — possibly coming by 2027, according to intelligence sources — could cut off the chip supply.\\n\\nAnd with a too little, too late response by tech giants grinding forward, a chip shortage could crush the tech industry, hobble the U.S. economy and keep your next iPhone out of reach for a long time, according to a new report.\\n\\n## Why Apple users should care about a potential Taiwan chip disaster',\n",

Since then, price has been **choppy/range-bound** with lower highs vs the early‑Feb peak (roughly mid‑260s to upper‑270s).\\n- **Momentum (MACD):** MACD turned up strongly in late Jan/early Feb (bullish momentum expansion), then **momentum faded** as the histogram rolled over and compressed toward zero. Latest bars show **slight re‑improvement**, but not a strong impulse.\\n- **Notable crossovers:** A **bullish MACD crossover** occurred in late Jan/early Feb and remains only **marginally positive/near flat** now—suggesting the up-move is losing strength and needs confirmation.\\n- **RSI (overbought/oversold):** RSI dipped near/under **30** around mid‑Jan (oversold) and rebounded to the **50–60** zone. It has **not reached overbought (70)** recently and is now around the **mid‑50s**, indicating neutral-to-slightly bullish momentum.\\n- **Near-term signals:**  \\n  - **Neutral/bullish bias** if price holds the mid‑260s area and MACD continues to curl up (potential continuation attempt).  \\n  - **Caution** if MACD flattens/turns down again and RSI slips back below ~50—would favor a **range breakdown / pullback** rather than trend continuation.',\n",

       " 'answer': '## Key strengths (from Apple’s FY2025 Form 10‑K)\\n- **Scale + profitability with growing Services mix:** FY2025 net sales were **$416.2B (+6% YoY)** with **Services $109.2B (+14%)** and Products **$307.0B**. Services growth was driven primarily by **advertising, the App Store and cloud services**. Net income was **$112.0B**.  \\n- **Strong liquidity and cash generation:** Apple reported **$132.4B** of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities (9/27/2025) and believes this plus operating cash flow and debt market access is sufficient for needs **over the next 12 months and beyond**.  \\n- **Capital return capacity:** In FY2025 Apple **repurchased $89.3B** of stock and paid **$15.4B** in dividends; it announced a **new $100B** repurchase authorization (May 2025) and raised the quarterly dividend to **$0.26**.  \\n- **Product breadth and refresh cadence:** The report highlights multiple FY2025 launches across Mac, iPad, iPhone and OS updates, including **iPhone 17 family** and new Apple Watch/AirPods updates in 4Q25.\\n\\n## Key risks\\n- **Tariffs / trade restrictions and geopolitics:** Apple notes new **U.S. tariffs announced beginning 2Q25** (including on imports from **China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the EU**) and warns tariffs/retaliation can materially impact **supply chain, component/raw material availability, pricing and gross margin**; ultimate impact is uncertain.  \\n- **Supply chain concentration + component constraints:** Certain components are sourced from **single or limited sources**; industry-wide shortages and commodity price swings can occur. Substantially all hardware is manufactured by outsourcing partners located primarily in **China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam**.  \\n- **Regulatory/antitrust pressure on platform economics:** The report details EU **Digital Markets Act** actions, including a **€500M fine** (Article 5(4) investigation) and ongoing Article 6(4) proceedings with potential fines up to **10% of annual worldwide net sales**. It also describes the **DOJ smartphone antitrust lawsuit** and ongoing App Store-related litigation (including Epic).  \\n- **Margin and demand volatility (incl. concentration in a major product category):** Apple flags risks to net sales and gross margin from competition, pricing pressure, product cycle timing, supply shortages, FX, inflation, and tariffs—and notes it generates a significant portion of net sales from a **single product category**, so a demand decline there could materially hurt results.  \\n- **FX headwinds:** A strengthening U.S. dollar can reduce reported net sales and gross margins; Apple notes hedging may not fully offset adverse moves.\\n\\n## Near-term outlook (next 12 months)\\n- **Financial flexibility remains strong:** Management states liquidity is sufficient to fund operations and the capital return program **over the next 12 months and beyond**.  \\n- **Mix tailwinds vs. macro/trade uncertainty:** Services is growing faster than Products (FY2025 **+14% vs. +4% iPhone**), supporting revenue resilience, but Apple emphasizes uncertainty from **macroeconomic conditions** (inflation, interest rates, currency) and **tariffs/trade measures** that could pressure demand and margins.  \\n- **Geographic trend to watch:** FY2025 **Greater China net sales declined 4% YoY** (driven primarily by lower iPhone sales), while Americas and Europe grew (Americas +7%, Europe +10%).',\n",

Since mid‑Feb, price looks **range‑bound/choppy** with lower follow‑through after the bounce.\\n- **Momentum (MACD):** MACD turned up strongly in late Jan/early Feb (histogram expanded positive), but **momentum has faded**—histogram has been shrinking and is near flat, suggesting the prior upside impulse is losing steam.\\n- **Notable crossovers (MACD):** A **bullish MACD crossover** occurred around late Jan/early Feb. More recently, MACD and signal are **converging near the zero line**, hinting at a potential **bearish crossover** if weakness continues.\\n- **RSI (14):** RSI bottomed near/under **30 (oversold)** in mid‑Jan, then recovered. Recently RSI is around the **mid‑40s to ~50**, **not overbought** (no 70+), but also not showing strong bullish momentum.\\n- **Near‑term signals:** With **RSI slipping below/around 50** and **MACD flattening near zero**, the setup leans **neutral-to-cautious**. A **bearish MACD cross** would favor a pullback/mean reversion; conversely, RSI reclaiming **>50–55** with MACD re‑expanding positive would signal the bounce is resuming.',\n",

       "  'answer': '## Key strengths (fundamentals)\\n- **Scale + profitability**: FY2025 net sales **$416.2B** (Products **$307.0B**, Services **$109.2B**) with gross margin **$195.2B** and operating income **$133.1B**. Services grew **14% YoY** to **$109.2B**, driven by **advertising, App Store, and cloud services**.  \\n- **Diversified revenue streams, but anchored by iPhone**: iPhone remains the largest category at **$209.6B** (+4% YoY, helped by higher Pro mix). Mac **$33.7B** (+12%), iPad **$28.0B** (+5%).  \\n- **Integrated product ecosystem / differentiation**: Apple emphasizes designing “nearly the entire solution” (hardware, OS, apps, services) and competes on **features (incl. security), quality/reliability, design/innovation, third‑party ecosystem, distribution, support, and reputation**.  \\n- **Financial flexibility + capital returns**: Cash/cash equivalents + marketable securities totaled **$132.4B** (Sept 27, 2025). Apple states this plus operating cash flow and debt-market access is sufficient for cash needs and capital return program “over the next 12 months and beyond.” In FY2025 it repurchased **$89.3B** of stock and paid **$15.4B** in dividends; a new **$100B** repurchase authorization was announced in May 2025.\\n\\n## Key risks to monitor\\n- **Macro sensitivity**: Apple notes inflation, interest rates, FX, and recessionary conditions can reduce consumer spending and demand; worsening conditions can also stress suppliers/partners and increase credit/collectibility risk.  \\n- **Geopolitics / trade restrictions / tariffs**: Apple highlights that restrictions on international trade can raise costs or limit availability of products/components and force operational changes. It specifically notes **new U.S. tariffs announced beginning Q2 2025** (covering imports from multiple regions) and uncertainty around further changes (including a Section 232 semiconductor-related investigation).  \\n- **Supply chain concentration & single/limited-source components**: Certain components are **single/limited sourced**, custom parts may have initial capacity constraints, and “substantially all” hardware manufacturing is done by outsourcing partners primarily in **China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam**—making disruptions more impactful.  \\n- **Competitive pressure / margin pressure**: Markets are “highly competitive,” with aggressive pricing and “downward pressure on gross margins.” Apple also warns net sales/gross margins can be pressured by pricing actions, competition, supply shortages, component cost increases, FX, tariffs, and product mix shifts.  \\n- **Geographic exposure (notably Greater China)**: FY2025 Greater China net sales were **$64.4B** and declined **4% YoY**, primarily due to lower iPhone sales (partly offset by higher Mac).\\n\\n## 6-month fundamental outlook (base case)\\n- **Demand/mix**: Near-term results likely hinge on iPhone cycle execution and mix (FY2025 iPhone growth was driven by **Pro models**), with **Services** continuing to be a key stabilizer given its **14% YoY** growth drivers (ads/App Store/cloud).  \\n- **Margins**: Expect ongoing **margin push-pull**: Services mix helps, but Apple flags continued **pricing pressure**, potential **component cost** volatility, **FX headwinds**, and **tariff/trade** impacts as key downside variables.  \\n- **Supply chain / geopolitics**: Elevated risk of disruption or cost inflation remains due to concentrated manufacturing footprint and the possibility of additional tariff actions; Apple explicitly says the ultimate tariff impact is **uncertain** and could affect **pricing and gross margin**.  \\n- **Capital return support**: Continued buybacks/dividends are supported by Apple’s stated liquidity position and ongoing operating cash generation (FY2025 operating cash flow **$111.5B**), which can cushion per-share fundamentals over the next two quarters.\\n\\n*Note: The retrieved filing context available here is Apple’s FY2025 Form 10‑K excerpts (not FY2023). If you want the outlook framed specifically off FY2023 disclosures, I can re-run retrieval targeted to the FY2023 10‑K.*',\n",

       "  'technical_section': 'Over the last 3 months AAPL fell into mid-January, rebounded sharply into early February, and has since turned choppy/range-bound. Momentum has faded: MACD is still slightly positive but flattening near the zero line (risk of a bearish crossover), while RSI has recovered from oversold but sits around ~48, suggesting neutral-to-cautious near-term positioning rather than a strong uptrend.',\n",

Key offsets are macro sensitivity, competitive/margin pressure, and elevated trade/tariff and supply-chain concentration risks (including uncertainty from new U.S. tariffs beginning Q2 2025 and reliance on limited-source components and outsourced manufacturing). Over the next 6 months, Services growth and capital returns (FY2025 buybacks $89.3B; new $100B authorization) are supportive, but margins and demand can be pressured by FX, tariffs, component costs, and iPhone mix/cycle execution.',\n",

Apple also signaled supply-chain shifts via plans to buy 100M+ chips from TSMC’s Arizona fab in 2026, which could help resilience but is not an immediate earnings driver.',\n",
