Revenues and profits follow a bell-curve with a\\nsignificant portion accruing in the April-June quarter.  \\nIn CY 2024, VBL delivered a robust performance, driven by\\na combination of organic volume expansion, an improved\\nproduct mix, and contributions from recent acquisitions.\\nConsolidated sales volume increased by 23.2%, while the\\nnet realization per case rose by 1.3%, leading to revenue\\ngrowth of 24.7% and PAT growth of 25.3%.  \\nNet revenue from operations reached ₹ 200,076.5 Million\\nin CY 2024, surpassing ₹ 160,425.8 Million recorded\\nin CY 2023. Total sales volumes for CY 2024 stood at\\n1,124.4 Million cases, up from 912.9 Million cases in the\\nprevious year. The company registered double-digit\\ngrowth in both Indian and international operations, with\\nIndia growing by 11.4% and consolidated volumes rising by\\n23.2%. However, organic volume growth in international\\nmarkets stood at 6.3%, impacted by the transition to a\\nzero-sugar portfolio following the implementation of a\\nsugar tax in Zimbabwe. In CY 2024, CSD accounted for\\n74.2% of total sales volumes, JBD at 6.2%, and Packaged\\nDrinking Water at 19.6%. Realization per case increased\\nby 1.3% to ₹ 177.9 for the year.  \\nDuring the fiscal year, gross margins improved by\\n165 basis points to 55.5%, compared to 53.8% in the\\nprevious year. This expansion was primarily driven by\\nthe strategic procurement and storage of PET chips to\\navail price benefits, along with efforts to reduce sugar\\ncontent and increased backward integration. As a result,\\nEBITDA increased by 30.5% to ₹ 47,110.7 Million, with\\nEBITDA margins improving by 105 basis points to 23.5%\\nin CY 2024. However, this was partially offset by the\\nconsolidation of the South African market and the fixed\\ncosts associated with new capital expenditures, which\\nare yet to be fully utilized.  \\nDepreciation recorded a 39.1% increase in CY 2024,\\nwhile finance costs rose by 68.0%, primarily due to the\\nacquisition of BevCo and the establishment of four new\\nproduction facilities in India and the Democratic Republic  \\nof the Congo (DRC). PAT saw a notable increase of 25.3%,\\nreaching ₹ 26,342.8 Million in CY 2024, compared to\\n₹ 21,018.1 Million in CY 2023, driven by volume growth and\\nimproved margins.  \\nAs of the end of CY 2024, the company\\'s net capital\\nexpenditure stood at approximately ₹ 45,000 Million,\\nwith ₹ 24,000 Million spent in CY 2023. Of the total capex,\\n₹ 32,000 Million was allocated for the establishment\\nof four greenfield production facilities, distributed as\\nfollows: Supa (Maharashtra) ~₹ 10,000 Million, Gorakhpur\\n(Uttar Pradesh) ~₹ 11,000 Million, Khordha (Odisha)\\n~₹ 5,000 Million, and DRC ~₹ 6,000 Million.

Financial instruments risk  \\n##### Financials risk management objectives and policies  \\nThe Company is exposed to various risks in relation to financial instruments. The main types of financial risks are\\nmarket risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.  \\nThe management of the Company monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the\\nCompany on a continuous basis. The Company\\'s risk management is coordinated at its head office, in close\\ncooperation with the management, and focuses on actively securing the Company\\'s short to medium-term cash\\nflows and simultaneously minimising the exposure to volatile financial markets. Long-term financial investments\\nare managed to generate lasting returns.  \\nThe Company does not engage in the trading of financial assets for speculative purposes. The most significant\\nfinancial risks to which the Company is exposed are described below.  \\n##### 52.1 Market risk analysis  \\nMarket risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of\\nchanges in market prices. The Company is exposed to market risk through its use of financial instruments and\\nspecifically to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk which result from its operating,\\ninvesting and financing activities. Contracts to hedge exposures in foreign currencies, interest rates etc. are\\nentered into wherever considered necessary by the management.  \\n##### Foreign currency risk  \\nForeign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of\\nchanges in foreign exchange rates. The functional currency of the Company is Indian Rupees (\\'INR\\' or \\'?\\'). Most of\\nthe Company\\'s transactions are carried out in Indian Rupees. Exposures to currency exchange rates mainly arise\\nfrom the Company\\'s overseas sales and purchases, lending to overseas subsidiary companies, external commercial\\nborrowings etc. which are primarily denominated in US Dollars (\\'USD\\'), Pound Sterling (\\'GBP\\'), Australian Dollars\\n(\\'AUD\\'), Euro (\\'EUR\\'), Emirati Dirham (\\'AED\\') and South African Rand (\\'ZAR\\').  \\nThe Company has limited exposure to foreign currency risk and thereby it mainly relies on natural hedge. To\\nfurther mitigate the Company\\'s exposure to foreign currency risk, non-INR cash flows are continuously monitored\\nand derivative contracts are entered into wherever considered necessary.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Varun Beverages Limited\" -->\\n<!-- PageNumber=\"424\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n<figure>  \\n<!-- PageHeader=\"FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\" -->  \\n</figure>  \\n<!-- PageHeader=\"STATUTORY REPORTS\" -->\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"CORPORATE OVERVIEW\" -->\\n\\n[7] company=VBL year=2024 doc_type=annual_report\\n### Monitoring and Reporting  \\nContinuously monitor risks and refine mitigation\\nstrategies based on performance.  \\nRegularly update and share risk reports to ensure\\ntransparency and informed decision-making.  \\n<figure>  \\n☒  \\nRISK\\nMANAGEMENT  \\n!  \\n</figure>  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Annual Report 2024\" -->\\n<!-- PageNumber=\"117\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n<figure>  \\n<!-- PageHeader=\"V3 VARUN BEVERAGES\" -->  \\n</figure>\\n\\n[8] company=VBL year=2024 doc_type=annual_report\\n### Interest rate risk  \\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because\\nof changes in market interest rates. The Company\\'s policy is to minimise interest rate cash flow risk exposures on\\nlong-term financing. The Company is exposed to changes in market interest rates as some of the bank and other\\nborrowings are at variable interest rates and also loans have been advanced to subsidiary companies at variable\\ninterest rates. All the Company\\'s term deposits are at fixed interest rates.  \\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of profit and equity to a reasonably possible change in interest\\nrates of +/- 1% (31 December 2023: +/- 1%). These changes are considered to be reasonably possible based on\\nmanagement\\'s assessment. The calculations are based on a change in the average market interest rate for each\\nperiod, and the financial instruments held at each reporting date that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. All\\nother variables are held constant.  \\n(₹ in million)  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th rowspan=\"2\">Particulars</th>\\n<th colspan=\"2\">Profit/(Loss) for the year</th>\\n<th colspan=\"2\">Equity</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<th>+1%</th>\\n<th>-1%</th>\\n<th>+1%</th>\\n<th>-1%</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>31 December 2024</td>\\n<td>(133.00)</td>\\n<td>133.00</td>\\n<td>(133.00)</td>\\n<td>133.00</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>31 December 2023</td>\\n<td>(320.71)</td>\\n<td>320.71</td>\\n<td>(320.71)</td>\\n<td>320.71</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Varun Beverages Limited\" -->\\n<!-- PageNumber=\"426\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n<figure>  \\n<!-- PageHeader=\"FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\" -->  \\n</figure>  \\n<!-- PageHeader=\"STATUTORY REPORTS\" -->\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"CORPORATE OVERVIEW\" -->', name='company_retriever', id='bbeed1c3-6ed6-40c5-a79d-b44a7d1f3a01', tool_call_id='call_M5gEEK5OZulFSIlDr5bZxVZn'), AIMessage(content='## Varun Beverages Ltd (VBL) — FY ended 31 Dec 2024 (Annual Report 2024)\\n\\n### Key financial highlights (Consolidated)\\n- **Total income (revenue + other income):** ₹ **206,025.96m** (FY23: ₹164,004.22m)  \\n- **Revenue from operations:** ₹ **204,813.28m** (FY23: ₹163,210.63m)  \\n- **Net revenues (after excise duty):** ₹ **200,076.50m**, **+24.7% YoY** (FY23: ₹160,425.81m)  \\n- **EBITDA:** ₹ **47,110.71m**, **+30.5% YoY** (FY23: ₹36,094.85m)  \\n- **Profit before tax (PBT):** ₹ **34,330.89m**, **+25.3% YoY** (FY23: ₹27,393.60m)  \\n- **Net profit (PAT):** ₹ **26,342.85m**, **+25.3% YoY** (FY23: ₹21,018.13m)  \\n  - **PAT attributable to owners:** ₹ **25,946.33m** (FY23: ₹20,559.22m)\\n\\n### Cash flow highlights (Consolidated)\\n- **Net cash from operating activities (CFO):** ₹ **33,810.97m** (FY23: ₹23,907.78m)  \\n- **Net cash used in investing (CFI):** ₹ **(43,167.80)m** (FY23: ₹(32,898.67)m)  \\n  - Includes **capex** (purchase of PPE/ROU/intangibles) of ₹ **(37,790.10)m**\\n- **Net cash from financing (CFF):** ₹ **29,535.37m** (FY23: ₹9,849.00m)  \\n  - Includes **equity issuance (QIP & ESOPs)** proceeds of ₹ **75,118.80m**\\n- **Net increase in cash & equivalents:** ₹ **20,178.54m**  \\n- **Cash & equivalents (end of year):** ₹ **22,662.83m** (FY23: ₹2,422.12m)\\n\\n### Segment / geography performance\\n- **Single operating segment:** manufacturing and sale of beverages (no separate business segments).  \\n- **Geographical revenue from operations (₹m):**\\n  - **India:** ₹ **141,755.87m** (FY23: ₹125,763.47m)\\n  - **Outside India:** ₹ **63,057.41m** (FY23: ₹37,447.16m)\\n- **Geographical non-current assets (₹m):**\\n  - **India:** ₹ **106,527.75m** (FY23: ₹89,820.78m)\\n  - **Outside India:** ₹ **44,274.15m** (FY23: ₹18,861.25m)\\n\\n### Management commentary / outlook signals (from report narrative)\\n- The report attributes CY2024 performance to **organic volume expansion, improved product mix, and contributions from recent acquisitions**, with **revenue +24.7%** and **PAT +25.3%**.  \\n- It notes **gross margin improvement** driven by **PET chip procurement/storage, sugar reduction, and backward integration**, while also noting offsets from **South Africa consolidation** and **fixed costs from new capex not yet fully utilized**.  \\n- It also states the company became **net debt-free** after loan repayment using QIP proceeds.  \\n*(The annual report includes a general cautionary statement that forward-looking statements may differ from actual results.)*\\n\\n### Major risks highlighted (with examples of mitigations)\\n- **Demand risk:** cyclical downturn could slow sales;

Revenues and profits follow a bell-curve with a\\nsignificant portion accruing in the April-June quarter.  \\nIn CY 2024, VBL delivered a robust performance, driven by\\na combination of organic volume expansion, an improved\\nproduct mix, and contributions from recent acquisitions.\\nConsolidated sales volume increased by 23.2%, while the\\nnet realization per case rose by 1.3%, leading to revenue\\ngrowth of 24.7% and PAT growth of 25.3%.  \\nNet revenue from operations reached ₹ 200,076.5 Million\\nin CY 2024, surpassing ₹ 160,425.8 Million recorded\\nin CY 2023. Total sales volumes for CY 2024 stood at\\n1,124.4 Million cases, up from 912.9 Million cases in the\\nprevious year. The company registered double-digit\\ngrowth in both Indian and international operations, with\\nIndia growing by 11.4% and consolidated volumes rising by\\n23.2%. However, organic volume growth in international\\nmarkets stood at 6.3%, impacted by the transition to a\\nzero-sugar portfolio following the implementation of a\\nsugar tax in Zimbabwe. In CY 2024, CSD accounted for\\n74.2% of total sales volumes, JBD at 6.2%, and Packaged\\nDrinking Water at 19.6%. Realization per case increased\\nby 1.3% to ₹ 177.9 for the year.  \\nDuring the fiscal year, gross margins improved by\\n165 basis points to 55.5%, compared to 53.8% in the\\nprevious year. This expansion was primarily driven by\\nthe strategic procurement and storage of PET chips to\\navail price benefits, along with efforts to reduce sugar\\ncontent and increased backward integration. As a result,\\nEBITDA increased by 30.5% to ₹ 47,110.7 Million, with\\nEBITDA margins improving by 105 basis points to 23.5%\\nin CY 2024. However, this was partially offset by the\\nconsolidation of the South African market and the fixed\\ncosts associated with new capital expenditures, which\\nare yet to be fully utilized.  \\nDepreciation recorded a 39.1% increase in CY 2024,\\nwhile finance costs rose by 68.0%, primarily due to the\\nacquisition of BevCo and the establishment of four new\\nproduction facilities in India and the Democratic Republic  \\nof the Congo (DRC). PAT saw a notable increase of 25.3%,\\nreaching ₹ 26,342.8 Million in CY 2024, compared to\\n₹ 21,018.1 Million in CY 2023, driven by volume growth and\\nimproved margins.  \\nAs of the end of CY 2024, the company\\'s net capital\\nexpenditure stood at approximately ₹ 45,000 Million,\\nwith ₹ 24,000 Million spent in CY 2023. Of the total capex,\\n₹ 32,000 Million was allocated for the establishment\\nof four greenfield production facilities, distributed as\\nfollows: Supa (Maharashtra) ~₹ 10,000 Million, Gorakhpur\\n(Uttar Pradesh) ~₹ 11,000 Million, Khordha (Odisha)\\n~₹ 5,000 Million, and DRC ~₹ 6,000 Million.

Financial instruments risk  \\n##### Financials risk management objectives and policies  \\nThe Company is exposed to various risks in relation to financial instruments. The main types of financial risks are\\nmarket risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.  \\nThe management of the Company monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the\\nCompany on a continuous basis. The Company\\'s risk management is coordinated at its head office, in close\\ncooperation with the management, and focuses on actively securing the Company\\'s short to medium-term cash\\nflows and simultaneously minimising the exposure to volatile financial markets. Long-term financial investments\\nare managed to generate lasting returns.  \\nThe Company does not engage in the trading of financial assets for speculative purposes. The most significant\\nfinancial risks to which the Company is exposed are described below.  \\n##### 52.1 Market risk analysis  \\nMarket risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of\\nchanges in market prices. The Company is exposed to market risk through its use of financial instruments and\\nspecifically to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk which result from its operating,\\ninvesting and financing activities. Contracts to hedge exposures in foreign currencies, interest rates etc. are\\nentered into wherever considered necessary by the management.  \\n##### Foreign currency risk  \\nForeign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of\\nchanges in foreign exchange rates. The functional currency of the Company is Indian Rupees (\\'INR\\' or \\'?\\'). Most of\\nthe Company\\'s transactions are carried out in Indian Rupees. Exposures to currency exchange rates mainly arise\\nfrom the Company\\'s overseas sales and purchases, lending to overseas subsidiary companies, external commercial\\nborrowings etc. which are primarily denominated in US Dollars (\\'USD\\'), Pound Sterling (\\'GBP\\'), Australian Dollars\\n(\\'AUD\\'), Euro (\\'EUR\\'), Emirati Dirham (\\'AED\\') and South African Rand (\\'ZAR\\').  \\nThe Company has limited exposure to foreign currency risk and thereby it mainly relies on natural hedge. To\\nfurther mitigate the Company\\'s exposure to foreign currency risk, non-INR cash flows are continuously monitored\\nand derivative contracts are entered into wherever considered necessary.  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Varun Beverages Limited\" -->\\n<!-- PageNumber=\"424\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n<figure>  \\n<!-- PageHeader=\"FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\" -->  \\n</figure>  \\n<!-- PageHeader=\"STATUTORY REPORTS\" -->\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"CORPORATE OVERVIEW\" -->\\n\\n[7] company=VBL year=2024 doc_type=annual_report\\n### Monitoring and Reporting  \\nContinuously monitor risks and refine mitigation\\nstrategies based on performance.  \\nRegularly update and share risk reports to ensure\\ntransparency and informed decision-making.  \\n<figure>  \\n☒  \\nRISK\\nMANAGEMENT  \\n!  \\n</figure>  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Annual Report 2024\" -->\\n<!-- PageNumber=\"117\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n<figure>  \\n<!-- PageHeader=\"V3 VARUN BEVERAGES\" -->  \\n</figure>\\n\\n[8] company=VBL year=2024 doc_type=annual_report\\n### Interest rate risk  \\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because\\nof changes in market interest rates. The Company\\'s policy is to minimise interest rate cash flow risk exposures on\\nlong-term financing. The Company is exposed to changes in market interest rates as some of the bank and other\\nborrowings are at variable interest rates and also loans have been advanced to subsidiary companies at variable\\ninterest rates. All the Company\\'s term deposits are at fixed interest rates.  \\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of profit and equity to a reasonably possible change in interest\\nrates of +/- 1% (31 December 2023: +/- 1%). These changes are considered to be reasonably possible based on\\nmanagement\\'s assessment. The calculations are based on a change in the average market interest rate for each\\nperiod, and the financial instruments held at each reporting date that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. All\\nother variables are held constant.  \\n(₹ in million)  \\n<table>\\n<tr>\\n<th rowspan=\"2\">Particulars</th>\\n<th colspan=\"2\">Profit/(Loss) for the year</th>\\n<th colspan=\"2\">Equity</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<th>+1%</th>\\n<th>-1%</th>\\n<th>+1%</th>\\n<th>-1%</th>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>31 December 2024</td>\\n<td>(133.00)</td>\\n<td>133.00</td>\\n<td>(133.00)</td>\\n<td>133.00</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>31 December 2023</td>\\n<td>(320.71)</td>\\n<td>320.71</td>\\n<td>(320.71)</td>\\n<td>320.71</td>\\n</tr>\\n</table>  \\n<!-- PageFooter=\"Varun Beverages Limited\" -->\\n<!-- PageNumber=\"426\" -->\\n<!-- PageBreak -->  \\n<figure>  \\n<!-- PageHeader=\"FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\" -->  \\n</figure>  \\n<!-- PageHeader=\"STATUTORY REPORTS\" -->\\n<!-- PageHeader=\"CORPORATE OVERVIEW\" -->', name='company_retriever', id='bbeed1c3-6ed6-40c5-a79d-b44a7d1f3a01', tool_call_id='call_M5gEEK5OZulFSIlDr5bZxVZn'),\n",
