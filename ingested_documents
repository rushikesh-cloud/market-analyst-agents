# FUTURE-READY. ECO-STEADY.

Imagine a future where every sip quenches more than thirst - it
sustains life, preserves the planet, and inspires change. At Varun
Beverages Limited (VBL), India's leading PepsiCo franchisee, the
act of serving a drink has evolved into a profound responsibility
\- one of fueling lives, driving innovation, and safeguarding the
planet. For over three decades, we have refreshed millions while
steadily redefining what it means to be a responsible industry
leader. From crowded cities to remote rural markets, each bottle
we deliver carries not only the promise of refreshment but also
our commitment to a greener and more sustainable future.

Our operations delivered robust growth across key markets, with consolidated
revenues rising by 24.7% in CY 2024. We also made significant strides in
expanding our global and domestic footprint. The acquisition of South Africa
based Beverage Company (BevCo) and its subsidiaries has strengthened our
international footprint and marks a key milestone in expanding our presence in
the African market. Domestically, we commissioned three greenfield facilities
in Supa (Maharashtra), Gorakhpur (Uttar Pradesh), and Khordha (Odisha),
boosting production capacity in India. Additionally, our Kinshasa facility in the
DRC now operates at full capacity on a three-shift basis.

These key milestones along with our commitment to net-zero GHG emissions
by 2050, enhanced efficiency through backward integration across 17
production plants and a strong focus on water stewardship, circular economy
through plastic waste management, and the adoption of renewable energy,
reinforce our Future Ready growth strategy.

As we grow, we continue to push boundaries - expanding our reach across
continents, embracing innovations that lower environmental footprints, and
nurturing communities through sustainable practices.

With a future-ready portfolio and an eco-steady approach, we are not just
meeting today's demands but shaping a resilient and sustainable tomorrow.

Dear Stakeholders,
It gives me immense
pleasure to present the
30th Annual Report of
Varun Beverages Limited
(VBL).

Ravi Jaipuria
Promoter & Non-Executive Chairman


#### Overview of the year

We are delighted to share that CY 2024 has been a
year of healthy operational and financial performance
for VBL. Our revenue growth was supported by
organic volume expansion, improved product mix, and
contributions from recent acquisitions. India volumes
grew 11.4%, reflecting the strength of our distribution
network and operational execution during a dynamic
market environment. Our international business also
maintained strong momentum, with particularly
encouraging results from the African markets following
the successful integration of BevCo in South Africa
and the commissioning of our Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) facility. Consolidated volumes increased

by 23.2%, largely led by new territories resulting in
consolidated revenues increase by 24.7%, EBITDA
growth of 30.5%, and PAT growth of 25.3% for the year.

Throughout the year, we focused on expanding our
manufacturing footprint and improving our on-ground
execution capabilities. The commissioning of multiple
greenfield facilities across India and Africa, along
with strategic partnerships to diversify our portfolio
into snacks and value-added beverages, reflects our
commitment to capitalizing on emerging consumer
trends. Additionally, we took steps to further
strengthen our international presence by signing share
purchase agreements to acquire PepsiCo's business in

<!-- PageNumber="08" -->
<!-- PageFooter="Varun Beverages Limited" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->


<figure>

<!-- PageHeader="CORPORATE OVERVIEW" -->

</figure>


<!-- PageHeader="STATUTORY REPORTS" -->
<!-- PageHeader="FINANCIAL STATEMENTS" -->

Tanzania and Ghana, subject to regulatory and other
approvals. Integration of these acquisitions, along with
our operations in South Africa, shall strengthen our
presence in key international markets.


#### Strengthening growth capabilities

CY 2024 was marked by significant progress in
expanding our manufacturing footprint to meet growing
demand across key markets. In India, we commissioned
three new greenfield facilities in Supa (Maharashtra),
Gorakhpur (Uttar Pradesh), and Khordha (Odisha).
These state-of-the-art plants have enhanced our
capacity to cater to the increasing demand in under-
penetrated markets.

Internationally, our Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
facility became operational and rapidly scaled to 100%
utilization within months. This remarkable performance
has reinforced our belief in the untapped potential of
the region, and we are now preparing for backward
integration and the commissioning of a second facility to
strengthen our operations further.

Furthermore, a key aspect of our growth strategy
is the continuous expansion and enhancement of
our distribution network and chilling infrastructure.
Strengthening these areas is crucial for deepening our
presence in both established and under-penetrated
markets. These strategic investments reflect our
proactive approach to capturing growth opportunities
and ensuring we are well-prepared to meet
future demand.


#### Expanding partnership with PepsiCo

During the year, we deepened our collaboration with
PepsiCo, venturing into new segments and geographies
to diversify and grow our product portfolio. In CY 2024,
we entered into an Exclusive Snacks Appointment
Agreement to manufacture and package Cheetos in
Morocco by May 2025. Building on this momentum,
we signed another exclusive snacks franchising
appointment for "Simba Munchiez" in Zimbabwe and
Zambia, with distribution starting in February 2025, and
manufacturing set to commence by October 2025 and
April 2026, respectively. Our expansion into the snacks
market in these three countries marks a key milestone in
enhancing our portfolio and leveraging synergies with
our existing infrastructure.

(Odisha). These state-of-the-art
plants have enhanced our capacity
to cater to the increasing demand
in under-penetrated markets.


#### Accelerating growth in international markets

CY 2024 was a year of remarkable progress in
strengthening our presence in the African market. A
key milestone was the successful integration of The
Beverage Company Proprietary Limited (BevCo) in
South Africa, enhancing our operational capabilities
and accelerating growth across the continent. This
acquisition enabled the Company to consolidate its
presence in franchised territories in South Africa,
Lesotho, and Eswatini, while also securing distribution
rights in Namibia, Botswana, Mozambique, and
Madagascar. Building on this momentum, we further
expanded our footprint through strategic acquisitions in
key African regions.

We also entered into share purchase agreements to
acquire PepsiCo's business in Tanzania and Ghana,
subject to regulatory and other approvals. This includes
100% stake in SBC Beverages Tanzania Limited (SBCT),
a market leader with five manufacturing facilities. SBCT's
strong operational infrastructure and diverse product
portfolio, including PepsiCo brands and its own energy
drink, Supa Komando, position us to effectively address
the growing consumer demand in East Africa.

Similarly, our acquisition of SBC Beverages Ghana Limited
(SBCG) will solidify our footprint in West Africa.

At VBL, sustainability is a cornerstone of our strategy. This year,
we furthered our commitment to environmental stewardship
by broadening the scope of initiatives like PET recycling, PET
light-weighting, energy-efficient manufacturing, increasing
renewable energy contribution and water conservation. A key
focus is achieving a "net positive" water balance by replenishing
more water than we use through conservation, recycling,
and groundwater recharge projects.


#### Sustainability Initiatives

At VBL, sustainability is a cornerstone of our
strategy. This year, we furthered our commitment to
environmental stewardship by broadening the scope
of initiatives like PET recycling, PET light-weighting,
energy-efficient manufacturing, increasing renewable
energy contribution and water conservation. A key
focus is achieving a "net positive" water balance
by replenishing more water than we use through
conservation, recycling, and groundwater recharge
projects, thereby ensuring a positive impact on water
resources. These efforts align with PepsiCo's global
PEP+ objectives, reinforcing our shared commitment to
a sustainable future.

Through these strategic initiatives, we have established
a clear roadmap for long-term sustainability. As part
of this commitment, we have set ambitious Net-Zero
targets, officially validated by the Science Based Targets
initiative (SBTi), aiming to achieve net-zero greenhouse
gas emissions across our entire value chain by 2050.

Additionally, our dedication to environmental
stewardship has earned us a spot on the prestigious
CDP A List based on the 2024 CDP scores:

· A for Climate

· A- for Water Security

This recognition underscores our commitment to
sustainable practices and our ongoing efforts to
drive meaningful change. We continue to integrate
environmentally responsible practices across our
operations, minimizing our footprint while delivering
value to stakeholders. Sustainability remains central to
our growth, enabling us to make a lasting impact in the
communities and regions we serve.


#### QIP issue

In November 2024, we successfully raised ₹ 75,000
Million through a Qualified Institutional Placement
(QIP). Over 13.27 crore equity shares were allotted
at an issue price of ₹ 565 per share. This significant
capital raise demonstrates the trust and confidence
of investors in the Company's strategic direction and
long-term potential.

The proceeds from this QIP have strengthened our
financial position and provided the flexibility to
pursue our ambitious growth plans. These funds will
support our expansion into new geographies, strategic
acquisitions, and further investment in enhancing our
operational capabilities.


#### Dividend & share-split

At VBL, managing our business efficiently for the benefit
of all stakeholders is a cornerstone of our philosophy.
A critical element in delivering value to our shareholders
and securing their long-term confidence is through a
consistent and transparent return of capital. In alignment
with this approach, our Board of Directors established
a formal dividend distribution policy following the
Company's listing in November 2016.

To broaden our shareholder base and increase the
accessibility of our shares to a diverse range of investors,
we have sub-divided/split the existing equity shares of
VBL. Each equity share, previously with a face value
of ₹ 5 and fully paid-up, was sub-divided/split into two
equity shares each having a new face value of ₹ 2.

During the year under review, the Board of Directors in
their meeting held on July 30, 2024 declared an interim
dividend of ₹ 1.25 per Equity Share (face value of ₹ 5/-

per Equity Share) to the eligible equity shareholders
of the Company. Further, the Board of Directors have
also recommended a final dividend of ₹ 0.50 per Equity
Share (face value of ₹ 2/- per Equity Share) for the
Current Year 2024.


#### Message to stakeholders

As we reflect on another year of significant
achievements, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to all our
stakeholders for their trust and support. Your confidence
in VBL has been instrumental in driving our success.

As we move forward, we remain focused on
strengthening our market position, leveraging growth
opportunities in both domestic and international
markets, and maintaining our commitment to
sustainable practices. Our dedication to innovation,
strategic expansion, and sustainability continues to
guide our journey.

As we navigate dynamic market environments, we stay
focused on delivering sustainable growth and value while
upholding our standards of excellence. We look forward
to a future of continued success and shared prosperity.


#### Vote of thanks

We express our deepest appreciation to our
shareholders, investors, bankers, and creditors for
their support and belief in our vision. A special thanks
to our dedicated employees, whose tireless efforts
and commitment have been instrumental in our
achievements. We are also immensely grateful to our
Board of Directors for their guidance and strategic
insights, helping steer the Company towards new
opportunities and sustained growth. Your collective
contributions have been invaluable in our journey, and
we look forward to your continued partnership.

Warm regards,
Ravi Jaipuria
Promoter & Non-Executive Chairman

## Pouring Refreshments across Borders, Expansion in a World of Refreshment

Over the years, we have strengthened our global presence to become one of
the foremost franchisee of PepsiCo, with India as our primary revenue driver.
Beyond India, our operations now span international markets, including Nepal,
Sri Lanka, Morocco, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Lesotho, Eswatini, the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Namibia, Botswana, Mozambique &
Madagascar.

We successfully completed the
acquisition of South Africa-based
Beverage Company (BevCo) and
its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
strengthening our global portfolio.
Simultaneously, we advanced domestic
growth by commissioning three
greenfield production facilities in
India - located in Supa (Maharashtra),
Gorakhpur (Uttar Pradesh), and
Khordha (Odisha) - demonstrating
our commitment to high-growth
opportunities. Our greenfield facility
in Kinshasa, DRC, has achieved 100%
utilization on a three-shift basis, with
further expansion planned. We also
hold the franchise for various PepsiCo
products in these markets, along with
distribution rights in Namibia, Botswana,
Mozambique, and Madagascar,
reinforcing our position as a key player
in the global beverage industry.

## Who we are

As part of our strategic growth in Africa, we have strengthened our
presence by acquiring a 100% stake in The Beverage Company Proprietary
Limited (BevCo), South Africa, for manufacturing and distribution.

Building on this momentum, we signed a share purchase
agreement with Tanzania Bottling Company SA and
Ghana Bottling Company Limited to acquire 100% share
capital of SBC Tanzania Limited and SBC Beverages
Ghana Limited respectively, subject to regulatory and
other approvals, including but not limited to PepsiCo Inc.

Our expansion goes beyond beverages, as we deepen
our presence in the snacks segment. Varun Beverages
Morocco SA, a wholly-owned subsidiary, has been

appointed the exclusive manufacturer and packager
of Cheetos in Morocco, complementing our existing
distribution of Lay's, Cheetos, and Doritos.

Furthering this growth, Varun Zimbabwe and Varun
Zambia have partnered with Premier Nutrition Trading
LLC, Dubai (a subsidiary of PepsiCo Inc.) to manufacture,
distribute, and sell Simba Munchiez in Zimbabwe and
Zambia, where distribution has already begun.

### Building a Future that's Ready and Steady

#### Dear Stakeholders,

At Varun Beverages, sustainability
is not a choice; it is an imperative
that underpins how we operate and
grow. As one of the world's leading
beverage manufacturers, our role
extends beyond quenching thirst.
We ensure that every step of our
value chain contributes positively
to the planet, our people, and the
communities we serve.

Varun Jaipuria

Promoter, Executive Vice-Chairman and
Whole-time Director

The world around us is changing rapidly. Consumers
today demand more than just refreshing beverages.
They actually seek for responsible brands that stand for
environmental stewardship, social progress, and ethical
governance. At VBL, we recognize this shift and remain
persistent in our ESG commitments, ensuring that our
business scales sustainably while leaving a positive
impact on society.


#### Growing responsibly, sustaining progress

In CY 2024, we reinforced our footprint across global
markets, expanding operations into South Africa and
securing distribution rights in Namibia, Botswana,
Mozambique, and Madagascar. Our entry into the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), along with
pending acquisitions in Tanzania and Ghana, marks
another stride toward becoming a stronger global
player. In India, we deepened our distribution network,
added new Greenfield facilities, and strengthened last-
mile reach, all while embedding sustainability into our
growth model.

Our ESG focus remains consistent. This year, we
accelerated our sustainability efforts with a clear
emphasis on optimizing our carbon footprint, advancing

water positivity, and enhancing our renewable energy
mix. In alignment with our sustainability roadmap, we
continued integrating responsible sourcing, increasing
PET bottle recycling rates, and fostering social equity
through workforce inclusion and community initiatives.


#### Demonstrating our commitment to environmental stewardship

We took significant strides in reducing our ecological
footprint. We continued our efforts to integrate
renewable energy into our operations, with 16% of
our total energy consumption now derived from
sustainable sources, reinforcing our dedication to
clean energy adoption. Water conservation remained
a key priority, and through targeted initiatives, we
achieved a 19% reduction in water usage per liter
of beverage production compared to the base year
2020 further strengthening our position as a water-
positive organization. Our approach to plastic waste
management also saw substantial progress as we moved
closer to our goal of 100% PET bottle recycling by 2025,
achieving 88% recycling in CY 2024 - an improvement of
2% points over the previous year.

<!-- PageHeader="STATUTORY REPORTS" -->
<!-- PageHeader="FINANCIAL STATEMENTS" -->

Additionally, our focused measures on energy efficiency,
sustainable sourcing, and operational improvements
have reinforced our commitment to climate action. Our
collaborations with sustainability partners, including GEM
Enviro Management Ltd. and Deutsch Quality Systems,
have played a vital role in monitoring and enhancing
our waste management systems, carbon footprint
tracking, and water conservation efforts. These collective
initiatives reaffirm our pledge to balance business growth
with environmental responsibility, ensuring that we
operate in a manner that is both resource-efficient and
future-focused.


#### Upholding social responsibility

People remain at the heart of our sustainability journey.
We promised to shape a safe, inclusive, and empowering
environment for our employees and the communities
we serve. Workplace safety remained a top priority, and
through our collaboration with DuPont Safety Solutions,
we further strengthened best practices across our
manufacturing plants, ensuring a safer and more secure
work environment.

In our continued efforts to align business growth with
responsible employment practices, we introduced
structured ESG-linked incentive programs, motivating
our employees to actively contribute to our sustainability
goals. Diversity and inclusion remained key focus
areas, as we worked towards building a workforce that
promotes gender equity, fosters innovation, and enables
holistic professional growth.

Beyond our organization, we continued to create
meaningful social impact through targeted community
development initiatives. Our collaboration with Shiksha
Kendra School enabled access to quality education for
over ~34,000 underprivileged students till now, while
our AARU Clinics provided essential healthcare services
to more than 3,40,000+ individuals across India and
Nepal. Additionally, our skill development initiative,
Pravah, empowered over 17,000+ young individuals
with the tools and training needed to secure sustainable
livelihood opportunities. By prioritizing the well-being of
our employees and the broader community, we remain
committed to creating a future that is both ready for
change and steady in its focus on social progress.


#### Strengthening governance and ethical leadership

Governance remains a cornerstone of our sustainability
philosophy. We continued to strengthen our governance
framework to ensure transparency, accountability, and
ethical business conduct. By expanding ESG-centric
policies across our supply chain, we have reinforced
our commitment to responsible sourcing and supplier


<figure>
</figure>


Our near-term targets, validated
by the Science Based Targets
initiative (SBTi), set a clear path
to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2
GHG emissions by 60% by 2033
from a 2023 baseline, alongside a
60% reduction in absolute Scope 3
emissions. Furthermore, we are
committed to reaching net-zero
emissions across our value chain
by 2050. Our efforts have been
recognized with a strong CDP
score, reflecting our transparency
and dedication to sustainability.
This validation reinforces our
ambition to drive meaningful
change and lead the industry
towards a lower-carbon future.

engagement. Our focus on regulatory compliance and
risk management remains unwavering, ensuring that we
uphold the highest standards of corporate responsibility.


#### Future-ready, eco-steady

Looking ahead, we remain committed to driving
impactful change through our sustainability agenda.
Our journey towards becoming a net-zero organization
will be shaped by continuous innovation, responsible
resource management, and collaboration with
stakeholders who share our vision. By 2025, we aim to
achieve 100% PET bottle recycling and further accelerate
our efforts in water positivity and renewable energy
adoption.

As we move forward into yet another transformative
year, we stay true to our promise to grow responsibly,
act decisively, and build a future that is not only
prosperous but also sustainable.

## Materiality


## Prioritizing What Matters

To drive our sustainability efforts and align with our business goals, we
conducted a materiality assessment aimed at identifying key aspects critical
to our performance and impact. This assessment, guided by GRI principles
and in collaboration with Deutsch Quality Systems (DQS), helps us focus on
the most relevant Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) areas for
long-term growth.


### About DQS

DQS India, a subsidiary of DQS
Holding GmbH, is a globally
recognized expert in management
system certification, assessment,
and training, bringing invaluable
insight to our materiality assessment
process.


### Key goal

Our goal was to identify and
prioritize the economic, social, and
environmental aspects that are most
material to the company's long-term
success.

### Consistent re-evaluation

As the business environment
evolves, so do the priorities and
concerns of our stakeholders.
To ensure we stay aligned with
changing industry demands and
corporate goals, we commit to
regularly re-evaluating the material
aspects through ongoing dialogues
with stakeholders.


### Finalizing material aspects: The process

In collaboration with DQS, we
adopted a two-pronged approach
to determine our material aspects:
stakeholder engagement and
impact assessment. After identifying
five key stakeholder groups, we
engaged them through surveys
and discussions, identifying 29
metrics of high importance. These
metrics will evolve based on internal
and external factors, ensuring our
strategies remain adaptable.

### The 5 pillars of material aspects: Our ESG focus areas

The material aspects we identified
are grouped into five core
categories, aligned with the GRI
and United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs). At VBL,
we refer to them as the '5 Pillars of
Material Aspects', which include:

1\. Environmental

2\. Social Capital

3\. Human Capital

4\. Business Model & Innovation

5\. Leadership & Governance

Through a comprehensive review
of materiality assessments within
the beverages industry, these
pillars were carefully chosen to
guide our strategic focus and drive
sustainable growth.

#### Replenishing earth

Water is vital for existence. Unarguably, one of the
most precious gifts on Earth, it demands responsible
management and preservation.

India receives adequate rainfall every year. Most of
the rainwater freely flows back into the ocean without
adding much to the Earth's groundwater level. Being an
environmental steward, Varun Beverages takes assorted
measures to harvest rainwater and replenish the
groundwater table.

It has been our constant endeavor to recharge double
the water than we consume in producing our beverages,
nurturing sustainable balance in Earth's underground
reservoirs.

We remain committed to enhance the water recharge
levels in proportion to our growth in volume. It will
be steered through key emphasis on reducing the
water usage ratio, adding to the water bodies and
strengthening our portfolio of ponds for rejuvenating,
maintenance and upkeep.

### Staying water positive

Sustainable water management lies at the heart of our
strategy. In 2024, we remain committed to replenishing
more water than we consume, reinforcing our position
as a water-positive company. For every liter of water
consumed in production, we replenished significantly
more, ensuring sustainable reserves for future generations.


### The right to clean water

Access to clean water is essential for all forms of
life. VBL is dedicated to using water responsibly and
fostering resilience in our value chain. For CY 2024, we
are intensifying efforts to:

· Reduce overall water consumption.

· Enhance operational efficiency to ensure responsible
water use.

· Strengthen initiatives to safeguard clean water access
for local ecosystems and communities.


### Wastewater management

Ensuring the safe return of water to the environment is
a priority for VBL. In 2024, we reaffirm our commitment
to treating 100% of wastewater generated across all
manufacturing facilities in India through advanced
effluent treatment plants. This guarantees that
the water discharged back into ecosystems meets
stringent quality standards, minimizing any potential

## Rejuvenation of Water Bodies (RWB) - a New Initiative

In association with IIT-IIT, a non-profit foundation we launched the Community-
Led Rejuvenation of Water Bodies (RWB) program in 2024 across four key
locations: Parner (Maharashtra), Jodhpur (Rajasthan), Nelamangala (Karnataka),
and Sangareddy (Telangana).

This initiative follows a community-led approach, where we support the desilting of water bodies to restore their
capacity while enabling farmers to apply the nutrient-rich silt to their fields. The outcomes have been far-reaching,
adding 0.6 Billion liters of water capture capacity, enriching 2,600+ acres of farmland while engaging 790 farmers.


### Extending water security in Rajasthan

In Kishanpur Gram Panchayat, Jodhpur, water scarcity
was a daily struggle, especially for women and young
girls who walked over 1.5 km, multiple times a day
to fetch water, often carrying 10 liters per trip. In
summer, water bodies dried up and they solely depend
on government water tankers supply. Noticing the
rejuvenation work of Kherali Nadi in a neighbouring
village, local community member Mangna Ram
approached our implementation partner to revive Peepli
Nadi of Kishanpur. Today, thanks to this intervention,
the water body holds water for 11 months, significantly
reducing summer hardships and minimizing the
community's reliance on government water tankers.


### Reviving hope in Maharashtra

In Parner, Jamgaon Gram Panchayat, where farmers
primarily grow Kharif crops like onion, green gram,
and maize since access to water was limited. The
rejuvenation of Pan Mala Talao gave them a renewed
sense of hope, as they could now plan for a second
(Rabi) crop season and shift to other high-value crops
like Sugarcane. This milestone was met with a Jal Pooja
celebration, where over 200 community members,
including women, children, and senior citizens, came
together to mark this transformative moment.


### Strengthening livelihoods in Karnataka

In Basavapatna, Shivangage Gram Panchayat (Nelamangala), the rejuvenation of the local water body has
significantly improved water retention, increasing availability from six months to over a year. Water levels in wells
have risen by 200 feet, enabling a 10% increase in livestock and growing interest in fisheries. Farmers have benefited
from reduced water and fertilizer use by 50%, with 25% shifting to high-value crops. Inspired by these gains, the
community is now planning to expand storage to 50 Million liters, involve 50+ farmers, and form a women-inclusive
management committee, ensuring long-term sustainability.

### Empowering communities in Telangana

In Kalkur and Nalla Cheruvu water bodies, Machireddypalli Gram Panchayat (Sangareddy), water retention has
doubled from four to eight months, and water coverage has expanded from 25% to 50%. Water levels in wells have
risen by 50-100 feet, giving women better access to water for household needs and sparking interest in fisheries
and dairy-based livelihoods. For farmers, silt application has rejuvenated fields, enabling the cultivation of 30 acres
of previously fallow land. Building on this progress, the community is now focused on expanding water storage,
engaging more farmers, and forming an inclusive management committee with active participation from women,
ensuring long-term sustainability and collective ownership.


### Beyond water: A holistic impact

Through the RWB program, we have not only
restored water bodies but also unlocked new
opportunities for the communities we serve. With
improved water availability, farmers can now cultivate
a second crop, while the application of nutrient-
rich silt has enhanced soil quality, leading to a 30%
average increase in yield. Additionally, silt application
has reduced irrigation water usage by 10% and
fertilizer dependency by 20%, making farming more
sustainable. Improved access to water has enhanced
sanitation and hygiene, while reducing the time and
effort women spend fetching water, allowing them to
engage in other productive activities. The program
has also started paving the way for water-based
livelihoods, such as fisheries and livestock farming,
further strengthening rural economies.


### Scaling up: Our commitment for 2025 and beyond

As we move forward, we are committed to expanding
the RWB program to four new locations - Kota,
Begusarai, Gorakhpur, and Prayagraj - creating an
additional 2.6 Billion liters of water capture capacity,
engaging over 2,500 farmers and enhancing over
7,000 acres of farmland.

Further strengthening our role in water stewardship,
VBL has taken on the responsibility of Basin Leader
for the Yamuna Basin under the India River Basins
Collective Action Program (UNCEO Water Mandate).
This step reflects our commitment to not just water
conservation but also to long-term, collaborative
action for sustainable water management.


### Tech-enabled national water program

To enhance the efficiency and impact of our water programs, we leverage the IIT-IIT technology platform
(GIS-based) that provides real-time visual management of VBL's water initiatives and assets. At the water body
level, it enables accurate measurement of water capture and assessment, while a survey app allows on-demand
status updates of any water body. This data-driven approach strengthens decision-making, ensuring targeted
interventions and long-term sustainability.

## Sourcing with Care

We prioritize responsible sourcing to achieve our sustainability goals. VBL's raw
materials are sourced from suppliers who follow strict sustainability practices,
reducing our ecological footprint and supporting local communities. Our
suppliers are committed to water and energy efficiency, waste management,
and transitioning to net-zero, driving long-term growth and positive impact.

We closely track the progress
of our responsible sourcing
goals with key raw material
and packaging suppliers, who
account for over 90% of our
overall purchases. This enables
us to align their practices with
our sustainability objectives
moving forward.


### Environmental impact assessment

Our suppliers, aligned with the Supplier Code of
Conduct, are continuously innovating to source high-
quality raw materials in environmentally responsible
ways. They prioritize sustainability by adhering to strict
guidelines, ensuring compliance with waste disposal
and pollution control regulations. Key initiatives include
enhancing energy efficiency, transitioning to renewable
energy through solar and wind power, and replacing
conventional fuels with eco-friendly briquettes. In
addition, we promote ongoing plantation efforts for a
greener future and fulfill water requirements through
third-party suppliers or, where available, groundwater.


### Supplier Code of Conduct

Ethical and responsible sourcing of raw materials is
a core aspect of our supply chain management. To
support this, we have implemented PepsiCo's Global
Supplier Code of Conduct, which applies rigorously
to all suppliers, agents, consultants, vendors, and
contractors as a condition for doing business with
PepsiCo and its affiliates.

Business integrity and
anti-corruption

#### Hiring from transgender (TG) community

We are committed to building a diverse and inclusive
workplace by creating meaningful employment
opportunities for the transgender community. Our
journey began in 2023 with a pilot plant in Mahul,
Mumbai, hiring eight transgender employees.
Encouraged by its success, we expanded to Greater
Noida and Nelamangala, growing our team to 20+
members.

To foster inclusivity, we carefully selected plant
locations, built gender-neutral facilities, and
conducted sensitization workshops for all employees.
Beyond employment, we provide onboarding support
and sponsor gender-affirming surgeries. As we move
forward, we aim to extend these efforts across more
locations and functions in 2025.

#### Work at height and general safety rules

The safety guidelines for working
at heights (1.8 meters or more)
are designed to mitigate potential
hazards. These include reporting
safety hazards, injuries, incidents,
emergency preparedness, handling
hazardous materials and chemicals,
following special procedures, and
maintaining good housekeeping.
The system also addresses hazard
identification, risk assessment,
planning and preparation, use of
protective equipment, training
and certification, inspections,
and compliance with specific
requirements.


#### Incident management system

To ensure an injury-free workplace,
nominated members from each
plant undergo training in the
Incident Management System.
This system outlines injury types,
a communication matrix for
information sharing, incident
investigation procedures, roles, and
timelines for resolving incidents.


#### Safety interaction system

The Safety Management System
standard was successfully
implemented with comprehensive
training for nominated members
from each plant. It establishes a
process for leadership engagement
with employees and contractors
on safety matters. Additionally, the
schedule and frequency for safety
discussions on the shop floor, along
with tracking and trend analysis of
observations, were finalized.


#### Employee passport and contractor safety management

The Employee Passport and
Contractor Safety Management
system helps track and ensure
the completion of safety training
for contractors. This structured
approach aims to reduce risks
associated with contractor safety.
It covers processes for contractor
selection, contract preparation and
award, orientation and training, work
coordination, auditing, and contract
evaluation.


#### Major achievements in safety

### Employees

We have implemented a structured approach to minimize risks associated with contractor safety and ensure a
safe working environment, aligned with our ESG goals. This approach includes the careful selection of contractors,
preparation of contracts that outline safety performance expectations, awarding contracts after thorough due
diligence, providing orientation and training for contractor employees, overseeing contract work, and conducting
evaluations to ensure compliance and safety standards are met.


#### Contractor Selection

Orientation and Training

Contractor selection is a process of
screening the available and known
source through a process of evaluation
of his technical, financial, quality
background and equal safety records.

Before contracted work begins, it is
important for VBL to provide a health
and safety orientation to familiarize
contractor employees with essential
health and safety information and to
communicate hazards posed by VBL
operations.

Contract Preparation

Work Coordination and Auditing

The tender bid package should
be developed to include safety
performance expectations and
conditions for execution of the work.

The contract administrator
shall establish a process so that
contractor work is administered
to meet the contract's mandatory
health and safety requirements.


#### Contract Award

Contract Evaluation

The contract administrator shall confirm
that the contractor's proposal meets the
bid package's mandatory requirements.
Confirmation shall include collection
and review of the contractor's health
and safety documents.

Plant shall establish a process for
consistently evaluating contractor
safety performance. The process
should identify which contracted
work activities should be evaluated
and at what frequency.

#### Responsible sourcing and manufacturing

Ensuring quality during sourcing of raw materials and
manufacturing of beverages is fundamental to our
sustainability goals. Responsible sourcing through
PepsiCo approved suppliers, who successfully undergo
comprehensive screening and certification by PepsiCo, is
a key enabler in achieving this.

Constant efforts are also made towards enhancing
VBL's food safety capability and improving processes
and quality system across the supply chain. Risk-based
controls systems also play a significant role in mitigating
potential hazards and risks in the manufacturing
and support processes and complying with our food
management standards.


#### A promise for superior quality

Our promise for food safety and quality is fulfilled
through extensive measures taken by internal and
external quality teams across all manufacturing and
logistics centers. These include:

· Maintenance of own food safety manufacturing
system at every site. This must conform to PepsiCo's
global standards and regulatory requirements in India

· Strict adherence to PepsiCo's Global Food Safety
Policy within all VBL's production facilities. The policy

covers raw material sourcing, manufacturing process,
storage, shelf life, etc.

· Daily incorporation of food safety principles into
manufacturing processes across all manufacturing
sites

· Regular Food Safety Audits by third party

· Regular internal Food Safety Audits


#### Product labelling

Labelling is an integral part of fostering consumer
awareness, building trust and loyalty amongst them,
and ensuring regulatory compliance for the Company.
We strive to continually improve our labelling standards
and provide clear and accurate information about the
product. We also aim to provide essential information
about the nutritional value of our product and look
forward for more opportunities to educate our
customers, in collaboration with industry, governments,
and other stakeholders.

PepsiCo's Global Labelling Policy, FSSAI guidelines,
and other applicable laws and regulations for labelling
within India are duly followed for all products at Varun
Beverages.

### 2. Prioritizing nutrition

To deliver higher nutrient value across our product categories, PepsiCo is guided by the PepsiCo Nutrition Criteria
(PNC), which is also followed by Varun Beverages.

PNC enables our products to maintain a high nutrition value by guiding the Company on (a) standards of nutrients
to limit, (b) standards for food groups to encourage, and (c) standards for nutrients to encourage.


#### PepsiCo Nutrition Criteria (PNC)


##### Standards for Nutrients to Limit

Nutrients that have been well-
established as dietary factors that
can contribute to the risk of certain
non-communicable diseases, when
consumed in excess.

For nutrients to limit, the criteria
is based on a model diet of 2,000
kcal per day, with saturated fat
and added sugars at or below
10% of total energy, sodium at
or below 2,000 mg per day, and
no industrially produced partially
hydrogenated oils (PHOs).


##### Standards for Food Groups to Encourage

Food groups that have been
well-established as contributing
to healthier diets.


##### Standards for Nutrients to Encourage

Nutrients that have been
identified as being commonly
under-consumed in a given
population. They can vary by
market or region, and are often
called "shortfall nutrients"
contributing to healthier diets.


##### Guidelines on Sugar Content:

1\. WHO - 10% of total energy contribution.

2\. The Healthy Choice Standards - Less than 4.5g/100g.

3\. Beverages category for PepsiCo - 1g-7g/100 ml
(assuming 1cc liquid weighs 1g)

##### Customer Satisfaction and GRM

We are committed to prioritizing consumer
satisfaction through our Consumer Response Program.
This program is designed to swiftly address and
resolve consumer concerns and grievances, ensuring
a courteous and timely response. The mechanism
employed by us fosters a consumer-centric approach,
establishing a top down commitment to building trust
and enhancing transparency in addressing queries
and concerns.

Consumers can lodge their complaints through the
Toll-Free number available on product labels and
crowns. The PepsiCo Consumer Response System
(CRS) representative manages and organizes these
complaints, forwarding them to us through the Wilke
portal. Our Plant team, along with the Consumer Care/
Complaint Management System (CCMS) coordinator,
reviews the auto-generated email containing
relevant complaint details. The investigation involves
collaboration between our Plant team, Regional
Quality Coordinator (RQC), and CCMS coordinator.
Customer Relationship Executives (CRE) promptly
address the concerns reported.

A detailed analysis of each reported complaint is
conducted by all plants, leading to root cause analysis.
Corrective and preventive actions are implemented
by the plant team, initiating an improvement plan to
prevent the reoccurrence of concerns and ensuring
consumer satisfaction. This comprehensive approach
reflects our commitment to continuous improvement
and responsiveness to consumer feedback.


##### Feedback:

Feedback is sent to PepsiCo CRS team by CCMS
coordinator, and Pepsi International (PI) Team connects
and responds to consumers, subsequently on SOS
basis. The complaints are tracked and reviewed monthly
on the basis of its nature, flavour, category and plant.

## Ethical Business Conduct and Other Policies

To comply with the provisions of Regulation 17(5)
of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, we have adopted
"Code of Conduct for Board of Directors and Senior
Management". Code is available on the website of the
Company at https://varunbeverages.com/wp- content/
uploads/2023/03/19-Code-Of-Conduct- For-Board-
Of-Directors-and-Senior-Management- Revised.pdf

On the basis of declarations received from Board

our suppliers were involved in any instances of forced

rigorous certification process for all of our suppliers,
and we are no exception.

## Anti-corruption and Anti-bribery

We consistently monitor and communicate with
our employees to raise awareness about avoiding
involvement in any corrupt practices. These
communications are regularly disseminated through
internal channels and are also published on our
official website as part of our policies. The policy
commitments extend to all organizational activities
and are communicated to stakeholders via email and
the official website.

While we do not offer transition assistance programs
for continued employability post-retirement or
termination, we invest in training sessions for senior
and middle-level employees. These individuals play a
crucial role in developing processes and procedures to
prevent corrupt practices within the organization.

To fortify our commitment against corruption, we have
established anti-corruption policies and procedures,
which are effectively communicated to our business
partners. In our risk assessment, 100% of operations
are thoroughly evaluated for corruption-related risks,
and the assessment did not identify any significant
risks. Our unwavering commitment to ethical business
practices and compliance with relevant laws and
regulations is further ensured through the following
practices:


## Communication and Transparency

Effectively communicating our anti-corruption policies
and procedures to all business partners, including
suppliers and third parties, is a pivotal measure in
cultivating a culture of transparency and integrity.
By making these policies publicly accessible on our
website, we underscore our unwavering commitment
to transparency in our operations.


## Non-disclosure Agreements (NDAs)

Requiring third parties to sign Non-disclosure
Agreements (NDAs) that mandate compliance with
our anti-corruption policies is a prudent and proactive
measure to safeguard our organization against
potential corruption risks. These NDAs serve as legally
binding agreements, providing a robust framework to
reinforce our expectations for ethical behavior.


## Due Diligence

It is crucial to undertake thorough due diligence on our
business partners, particularly those operating in high-
risk areas or industries. This diligent approach ensures
that our partners align with and uphold our steadfast
commitment to anti-corruption measures and ethical
business practices. By rigorously assessing and vetting
our business partners, we strengthen the foundation
of integrity and reinforce our dedication to fostering a
business environment built on ethical conduct.

## Business continuity plan

Considering the highly volatile and unpredictable nature
of environmental and ecological disasters, Business
continuity is one of the utmost priorities for any
organization in the event of occurrence of any natural
disaster, pandemic, or any other likely event.

In case of any high risk event, to ensure there is no
disruption in the major business operations including
sales, production and financial related functions, we
have a detailed Business Continuity Plan in place to
implement the mitigation plan immediately, restore the
impacted operations within the defined time limits and
ensure all functions are operating well like back-up IT
servers, office facilities, raw material suppliers, etc.

Crisis Management teams are formed which will be in
immediate action at the time of any disaster.

Regular training is provided to them to ensure the clarity
of roles and responsibilities of all the teams for quick
response. Also, mock drills are conducted to check the
preparedness to tackle such situations.


## We have formulated a detailed risk management policy which includes:

· Framework for identification of internal and external
risks

· Measures for risk mitigation including systems and
processes for internal control of identified risks

· Business continuity plan

· Evaluate and review the risk management plan, the
risk management system, including risk policy, risk
process (risk identification, assessment, mitigation
and monitoring), cyber security processes and risk
registers laid down by the management

· Recommendation for appointment, removal and
terms of remuneration of the Chief Risk Officer

As intense heatwaves swept across the country,
thousands of families found themselves battling
severe water scarcity. With lakes drying up and
handpumps running empty, the necessity of
water became an urgent crisis. Recognizing this
dire need, VBL, through RJ Foundation, launched
an extensive Drinking Water Distribution Drive,

<table>
<tr>
<th>Risk</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Mitigation Plan</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Demand Risk</td>
<td>The risk of slowdown in the Company's target markets and adverse impact on its sales velocity caused by a cyclical downturn.</td>
<td>Varun Beverages strategic approach to provide the right brand featuring right products at the right price and through the right channels, has enabled the Company to grow consistently in its sales volumes. An extensive portfolio, comprising a wide range of products, helps it to cater to the varying tastes and preferences of diverse consumer segments. Steady growth is also attributed to presence in relatively underpenetrated markets with favorable demographics, growing population, and advantageous climate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Business Agreement Risk</td>
<td>The Company relies on strategic relationships and agreements with PepsiCo. Termination of agreements or less favorable renewal terms could adversely affect profitability.</td>
<td>Varun Beverages has steadily strengthened its partnership with PepsiCo over the past three decades, solidifying its market ties, expanding its territories and sub-territories, and diversifying its production and distribution capabilities across a broader array of PepsiCo beverages. These factors, along with the Company's focus on adding multiple SKUS into the portfolio and developing a stronger distribution network, has helped it to win a larger market share for PepsiCo, garnering its trust and continued patronage. The bottling appointment and trademark license agreement for India with PepsiCo India has been extended till April 30, 2039, from October 2, 2022, earlier, signifying strong partnership, built on the foundation of mutual trust and support. Collaborating as active development partners, investing in joint projects and business planning on strategic issues ensures a close and mutual beneficial relationship between the Company and PepsiCo.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Regulatory Risk</td>
<td>Regulatory risks to the Company include new and evolving regulations on consumer health. Business is also at the risk of adverse impact on account of Company's products being targeted for discriminatory tax and packaging waste recovery.</td>
<td>Sustainability is at the core of all business decisions and operations within Varun Beverages. Along with PepsiCo, the Company takes proactive steps to collaborate with the government and other regulatory authorities to ensure clear understanding of the facts and prevent unfair singling out of its products. VBL, along with the NGO's, communities it operates in, and other stakeholders, is continuously focused on establishing and implementing sustainability solutions in the areas of environment, social and governance. Eco- friendly manufacturing practices are consistently adhered to and strong emphasis is placed on addressing issues related to packaging waste recovery / recycling, water management and greenhouse gases emissions. As a part of its sustainability commitment and for phased implementation of 100% recycling of used PET bottles, VBL has collaborated with GEM Enviro Management Ltd. Measurement and improvement in the Company's carbon footprint and water footprint assurance is further achieved through alliance with Deutsch Quality Systems (India) Private Limited. The Company also aligns with PepsiCo's strategy of introducing healthier and "zero sugar" variant of products, solidifying its position as a responsible brand that cares for its consumers.</td>

<th>Mitigation Plan</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Business Viability Risk</td>
<td>Business viability risk amounts to the financial and/or performance risk stemming from Company's inability to integrate the operations of newly acquired territories and sub-territories or derive potential operating and cost efficiencies from them.</td>
<td>VBL's straightforward strategic approach and financial need ensures that any future acquisitions or partnerships comply with the Board's acquisition guideline and bring value to the Company. Performance of the newly acquired territories and business viability is ensured by the Company through concentrated efforts and initiatives. This includes significant financial investment and considerable time spent by the management to develop local market strategies that are capable of mitigating possible cultural and language barriers as well as incorporating existing business practices into new activities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Consumer Preference Risk</td>
<td>Inability to adjust with the evolving consumer health trends and failure in clarifying misunderstandings about the health impacts of consuming soft drinks could harm demand.</td>
<td>Close collaboration with PepsiCo enables the Company to regularly evaluate the evolving habits of its consumers and align its product innovation with the changing demand, therefore augmenting its range of products and remaining relevant in the competitive business landscape. PepsiCo's new and healthy product plan with greater focus on zero / limited calorie content and sugar content also augurs well for VBL.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Raw Material Risk</td>
<td>An interruption in the supply or significant increase in the price of raw materials or packaging materials may adversely affect the Company's business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.</td>
<td>A series of initiatives and programs are implemented at VBL to optimize cost and operational efficiencies. Concentrated efforts, including backward integration and consolidated procurement of raw materials, are constantly made to reduce the cost of goods sold and increase the Company's cash flows. The Company also enjoys a good bargaining power with its suppliers owing to its scale of operation, resulting in better work-ing capital management. Other than this, the Company is consistently committed to optimize its asset management and utilization, leading to higher operating efficiency and amortization of overheads costs on a wider case. Innovative solutions further augment VBL's process efficiency ensuring consolidated operational data from production, scheduled sourcing, and superior monitoring of the supply of goods from manufacturers to the retail point of sale.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sustainable packaging costs and market availability</td>
<td>The cost of recyclable materials, such as recycled PET (rPET) and aluminum, can affect packaging costs. Increased prices may impact our sustainability efforts, especially if these materials are essential for eco-friendly packaging. In areas with high plastic consumption, inadequate collection and recycling infrastructure can be a challenge. This may affect our ability to source recycled materials or manage our packaging waste effectively. Supply constraints or high costs can pose challenges to access to high quality recycled materials (like rPET) at reasonable prices</td>
<td>We are making substantial progress toward achieving our Mission 2025 commitment of 100% recycling rates. This includes efforts to increase the overall packaging collection rate, indicating a commitment to responsible waste management. Additionally, we are focused on increasing the use of recycled PET in our PET bottle packs, emphasizing a shift towards more sustainable packaging materials. Our target is to achieve 30% usage of r-PET in our total plastic consumption. We are working with GEM Enviro Management Ltd for recycling plastic waste, conducting awareness programmes for communities, uplifting the lives of ragpickers, etc.</td>

## Management Discussion & Analysis Report


### Economic Overview & Outlook Indian Economy

In 2024, India continued to demonstrate strong
economic performance, maintaining its position as one
of the world's fastest-growing major economies. The
International Monetary Fund (IMF) maintained India's
GDP growth forecast at 6.5% for both FY2026 and
FY2027, reflecting confidence in the nation's economic
trajectory. This stable outlook is supported by strong
private consumption, particularly in rural areas, and
substantial public infrastructure investments.

Despite global economic challenges, including
geopolitical tensions and inflationary pressures, India's
economic outlook remains positive. India is poised to
sustain its growth trajectory, supported by structural
reforms and advancements in technology. While certain
sectors face hurdles such as high inflation and slowing
consumption, these challenges create opportunities for
policy interventions to stimulate demand and ensure
inclusive growth. The government's proactive measures
in fiscal policy and infrastructure development are
expected to mitigate these issues, fostering a resilient
and dynamic economic environment.

### Soft Drinks Market Overview & Outlook

The Indian soft drinks industry navigated a challenging
landscape in 2024. Despite being a traditionally high-
growth market driven by increasing urbanization, a
growing middle class, and evolving consumer preferences,
demand remained subdued due to unexpected
weather patterns and weakened consumption trends.
The unseasonal rains in several parts of the country
significantly impacted sales, particularly during the peak
summer months, a critical period for the sector.

On the supply side, while the industry displayed resilience
with robust distribution networks and innovative product
launches, the benefits were limited by the macroeconomic
environment. Brands attempted to mitigate challenges
by offering value-for-money packs, introducing new
flavors, and leveraging digital platforms for marketing.
However, these efforts could not fully offset the dip in
overall volumes.

Looking ahead, the industry remains cautiously optimistic.
The upcoming summer season, coupled with strategic
marketing campaigns and an expanding portfolio of
products, is expected to drive growth in the Indian soft

drinks market. The adoption of sustainable packaging
and the introduction of low-sugar and no-sugar variants
continue to align with evolving consumer preferences,
creating a strong foundation for long-term growth.

Improved infrastructure has enhanced cold storage
and distribution capabilities, which are essential for the
beverage industry. The increasing deployment of Visi
Coolers in under-penetrated regions has played a key
role in improving product availability and market reach.
These advancements have facilitated access to chilled
beverages in emerging markets, driving consumption
and positioning the industry to tap into new growth
opportunities.


### Soft Drinks - Key Growth Drivers and Opportunities

The soft drinks market in India is poised for substantial
growth, driven by several key factors:

Urban Growth and Increasing Spending Power: Rapid
urbanization and a growing middle class have driven
higher consumption of convenience foods and beverages,
including soft drinks. With higher disposable incomes,
consumers are increasingly spending on-the-go beverage
options, enhancing demand for a diverse range of
products. Additionally, growing participation of women
joining the workforce is contributing to higher household
incomes, further enhancing consumer spending capacity.

Youth Demographic: India's large young population is
a significant driver of demand for trendy and innovative
beverages. Young consumers are more inclined to
experiment with new flavors, limited-edition variants, and
international brands, making this demographic critical for
industry growth.

Unlocking Growth in Rural India: Rural India presents
significant opportunities for growth, offering a vast,
untapped market. Strengthening last-mile distribution
networks, introducing smaller and more affordable
SKUs, and launching localized marketing campaigns are
strategies that can drive deeper penetration and unlock
new growth avenues. Additionally, expanding chilling
infrastructure, such as Visi Coolers, to underserved
locations remains crucial. Improved access to cold
storage ensures better availability of chilled beverages,
enabling brands to cater effectively to consumer
demand in rural and remote areas while driving
consistent growth.

<!-- PageHeader="FINANCIAL STATEMENTS" -->

Location: India's diverse climatic conditions, with a
significant portion of the population living in regions
characterized by hot, dry, or moderate weather, create
a natural demand for refreshing beverages. The rising
temperatures and prolonged summer seasons in many
parts of the country are expected to drive higher
consumption of soft drinks.

Innovative Products: Indian market has a large young
population that has been driving the demand for new
and unique flavors. To meet this trend, the industry is
continuously focusing on expanding its product offerings
and introducing innovative options, such as new and
creative flavors and packaging solutions.

Health Trends Shaping Demand: The growing focus
on health is driving demand for low-sugar, zero-calorie,
and functional beverages enriched with vitamins and
probiotics. Brands are innovating with organic and
natural ingredient-based drinks to cater to these evolving
consumer preferences.


### Business Overview - A Key Player in the Beverage Industry


#### VBL's Presence

Varun Beverages Limited ("VBL" or the "Company") is a
key player in India's beverage industry and the second
largest franchisee of PepsiCo in the world (outside US) with
operations spanning across 10 countries with franchise
rights and additional 4 countries with distribution rights.
India is the largest market and contributed ~72% of
revenues from operations (net) in Fiscal 2024.


#### Symbiotic Relationship with PepsiCo

VBL continues to enjoy a longstanding, collaborative, and
highly synergistic partnership with PepsiCo, a relationship

that spans over three decades since PepsiCo's entry into
the Indian market. The Company accounts for more than
90% of PepsiCo's sales volumes in India, highlighting
the significance of this collaboration. Leveraging an
extensive manufacturing infrastructure and a well-
established distribution network, VBL produces, markets,
and distributes a diverse range of PepsiCo products,
including carbonated soft drinks, carbonated juice-based
beverages, juice-based beverages, energy drinks, sports
drinks, and packaged drinking water.

The portfolio of PepsiCo CSD brands produced and sold
by VBL include Pepsi, Pepsi Zero, Mountain Dew, Sting,
Seven-Up, Mirinda, Seven-Up Nimbooz Masala Soda
and Evervess. PepsiCo NCB brands produced and sold

significant step in enriching VBL's portfolio and leveraging
synergies with its existing infrastructure.

### Business Model

The Company manufactures and distributes a wide
range of carbonated soft drinks ("CSD"), as well as a
large selection of non-carbonated beverages ("NCB"),
including packaged drinking water. With its end-to-end
execution capabilities, VBL oversees every aspect of
the value chain - from manufacturing and distribution
to warehousing, customer management, cash flow
optimization, and driving future growth. PepsiCo provides
brands, concentrates, and marketing support, while VBL
manages manufacturing, supply chain processes, and
capital allocation strategies, ensuring market share gains
and cost efficiencies.

VBL's extensive experience in the beverage industry
includes navigating the complexities of logistics
and packaging across diverse territories. While the
operational framework remains consistent across
markets, each region presents unique challenges such as
electricity reliability, refrigeration, logistics infrastructure,
demographic diversity, and socioeconomic conditions.
VBL addresses these challenges with tailored strategies
to ensure operational efficiency and responsiveness.

The Company's well-established distribution network
spans urban, semi-urban, and rural markets, enabling
it to meet the demands of a wide consumer base.
Strategically located distribution centers maximize
market penetration across licensed territories in India and
international markets. VBL's solid production capabilities
and distribution network enable it to effectively respond
to competitive pressures, market demand and evolving
consumer preferences across targeted territories.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company has 48 state-
of-the-art manufacturing facilities (36 in India & 12 in
international territories). Further, it has a robust supply
chain with 130+ depots, 2,600+ owned vehicles, 2,800+
primary distributors and presently installed 1.15 Million+
visi-coolers across various markets. These assets ensure
seamless product availability and enhanced market reach,
particularly in under-penetrated regions.

Over the years, VBL has grown its operations through
both organic and inorganic expansions. Inorganic growth
has been achieved through the acquisition of additional
territories directly from PepsiCo as well as previously
franchised territories. Supported by a dedicated and
skilled sales team, the Company remains focused on
driving growth and increasing market share across
categories within its licensed territories. VBL employs a
range of customer-focused strategies, including localized
promotions, in-store activations, customer relationship
management, merchandising, personalized account
management, and identifying high-demand areas for the
strategic placement of vending machines and visi-coolers.

To enhance operational excellence, VBL has implemented
backward integration initiatives and centralized raw
material sourcing. The Company has established in-house
production facilities for preforms, crowns, plastic closures,
corrugated boxes, corrugated pads, plastic crates, and
shrink-wrap films. These initiatives ensure consistent
quality standards, operational efficiency, and cost
optimization, further strengthening VBL's competitive
edge in the beverage industry.

Varun Beverages reports its financials on a calendar yearly
basis. Given that the soft drinks business is in season, with
the bulk of sales occurring during the summer season, it
is best to track the Company's performance on an annual
basis. Revenues and profits follow a bell-curve with a
significant portion accruing in the April-June quarter.

In CY 2024, VBL delivered a robust performance, driven by
a combination of organic volume expansion, an improved
product mix, and contributions from recent acquisitions.
Consolidated sales volume increased by 23.2%, while the
net realization per case rose by 1.3%, leading to revenue
growth of 24.7% and PAT growth of 25.3%.

Net revenue from operations reached ₹ 200,076.5 Million
in CY 2024, surpassing ₹ 160,425.8 Million recorded
in CY 2023. Total sales volumes for CY 2024 stood at
1,124.4 Million cases, up from 912.9 Million cases in the
previous year. The company registered double-digit
growth in both Indian and international operations, with
India growing by 11.4% and consolidated volumes rising by
23.2%. However, organic volume growth in international
markets stood at 6.3%, impacted by the transition to a
zero-sugar portfolio following the implementation of a
sugar tax in Zimbabwe. In CY 2024, CSD accounted for
74.2% of total sales volumes, JBD at 6.2%, and Packaged
Drinking Water at 19.6%. Realization per case increased
by 1.3% to ₹ 177.9 for the year.

During the fiscal year, gross margins improved by
165 basis points to 55.5%, compared to 53.8% in the
previous year. This expansion was primarily driven by
the strategic procurement and storage of PET chips to
avail price benefits, along with efforts to reduce sugar
content and increased backward integration. As a result,
EBITDA increased by 30.5% to ₹ 47,110.7 Million, with
EBITDA margins improving by 105 basis points to 23.5%
in CY 2024. However, this was partially offset by the
consolidation of the South African market and the fixed
costs associated with new capital expenditures, which
are yet to be fully utilized.

Depreciation recorded a 39.1% increase in CY 2024,
while finance costs rose by 68.0%, primarily due to the
acquisition of BevCo and the establishment of four new
production facilities in India and the Democratic Republic

of the Congo (DRC). PAT saw a notable increase of 25.3%,
reaching ₹ 26,342.8 Million in CY 2024, compared to
₹ 21,018.1 Million in CY 2023, driven by volume growth and
improved margins.

As of the end of CY 2024, the company's net capital
expenditure stood at approximately ₹ 45,000 Million,
with ₹ 24,000 Million spent in CY 2023. Of the total capex,
₹ 32,000 Million was allocated for the establishment
of four greenfield production facilities, distributed as
follows: Supa (Maharashtra) ~₹ 10,000 Million, Gorakhpur
(Uttar Pradesh) ~₹ 11,000 Million, Khordha (Odisha)
~₹ 5,000 Million, and DRC ~₹ 6,000 Million. An additional
₹ 8,000 Million was invested in international markets,
including backward integration. The remaining capex
was for future years, including visi-coolers, glass bottles,
pallets, vehicles, etc.

Investments made over the past two years have
significantly expanded production capacity in India, the
annual production capacity in India increased during the
season of CY 2024 by ~45% over the capacity of season
CY 2022. This expansion strengthens the company's
ability to meet growing demand and drive future growth.

As of December 31, 2024, capital work-in-progress
(CWIP) and capital advances stood at approximately
₹ 16,500 Million, primarily for new greenfield facilities in
Prayagraj, Damtal, Buxar, and Meghalaya. An estimated
₹ 16,000 Million in additional capital expenditure is
required, with the balance earmarked for the following
year. This includes investments in the snacks segment in
international markets and brownfield expansions in India
(Sricity), rPET facilities in India and expansion in DRC.

During the year, VBL became net debt-free following the
repayment of loans using proceeds from the QIP issue.
While the company's financial position has strengthened,
efforts to enhance operational efficiencies remain
ongoing. Despite inorganic expansion into new markets,
including South Africa and DRC, working capital days
improved to approximately 31 days as of December 31,
2024, compared to 34 days in the previous year.

VBL is well-positioned to sustain its growth trajectory,
driven by its comprehensive business model, robust
operational infrastructure, and strategic alignment
with PepsiCo. The Company's end-to-end execution
capabilities, from manufacturing to distribution, ensure
seamless operations across diverse and complex markets.
VBL continues to enhance its portfolio with innovative
product offerings and localized strategies, enabling it
to address evolving consumer preferences and capture
emerging demand across its licensed territories.

The Company's recent expansion into international
markets, including the integration of The The Beverage
Company Proprietary Limited (BevCo) in South Africa
and acquisitions in Tanzania and Ghana, has further
strengthened its global footprint. These developments
underscore VBL's commitment to broadening its
footprint and the expansion into African territories

provides the Company with new opportunities to
drive long-term growth and solidify its position in key
international markets.

In India, VBL is well-placed to leverage favorable
demographic trends and the growing spending power of its
expanding middle class. Investments in infrastructure, such
as Visi Coolers in under-penetrated rural regions, enhance
the Company's ability to reach a broader consumer base
and ensure consistent product availability. Additionally,
VBL's focus on backward integration, centralized sourcing,
and sustainability initiatives ensures operational excellence
and cost efficiencies. Complemented by the growing
snacks business under exclusive PepsiCo partnerships,
VBL is poised to deliver sustainable value to stakeholders
and capitalize on growth opportunities in both domestic
and international markets.

<tr>
<th>Risk</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Mitigation</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1. Demand Risk</td>
<td>A cyclical downturn can result in a slowdown in the Company's target markets, affecting its sales velocity.</td>
<td>Over the years, the Company has demonstrated its ability to drive significant growth in sales volumes by focusing on delivering the right brand, the right price, the right product, and the right channel. Additionally, the business operates in relatively under- penetrated markets with favorable demographics, climatic conditions and a growing population, indicating steady demand growth. Further, its wide range of product portfolio enables it to cater to diverse consumer segments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2. Business Agreement Risk</td>
<td>The Company relies on strategic relationships and agreements with PepsiCo. Termination of agreements or less favorable renewal terms could adversely affect profitability.</td>
<td>Over the past thirty years, the Company has nurtured a strong partnership with PepsiCo, expanding market ties by venturing into new territories and sub-territories. This partnership involves an expanded production and distribution of a wider array of PepsiCo beverages, integrating multiple SKUs into our portfolio, and broadening our distribution network. The business has demonstrated its effectiveness in significantly boosting PepsiCo's market share, establishing itself as a reliable partner. The collaborative relationship is symbiotic, with both entities actively engaged as development partners. Together, they invest in joint projects and business planning, with a primary focus on strategic issues. Notably, the bottling appointment and trademark license agreement for India with PepsiCo India, initially set to expire on October 2, 2022, has been extended until April 30, 2039, further strengthening this enduring partnership.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3. Regulatory Risk</td>
<td>Regulations regarding consumer health and the risk of the Company's products being signed out for discriminatory tax and packaging waste recovery may adversely impact business.</td>
<td>The Company proactively works with PepsiCo, the Government and the regulatory authorities to ensure that the facts are clearly understood and that its products are not unfairly targeted. VBL adheres to sustainable manufacturing practices and emphasizes on environmental issues related to packaging waste recovery / recycling, water management and greenhouse gas emissions. It consistently engages with stakeholders to develop sustainability solutions that prioritize environmental protection, including partnerships with NGOs and the communities in which it operates. PepsiCo's strategy of introducing healthier and zero sugar variant products also bodes well for the Company's future. The Company has initiated various sustainability initiatives such as the engagement of GEM Enviro Management Ltd. for phased implementation of 100% recycling of used PET bottles and partnering with Deutsch Quality Systems (India) Private Limited for water footprint assurance and, for measurement and improvement of Company's carbon footprint.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4. Business Viability Risk</td>
<td>The inability to integrate the operations or leverage potential operating and cost efficiencies from the newly acquired territories and sub-territories may adversely affect the Company's business and future financial performance.</td>
<td>VBL's transparent strategy and financial planning ensure that any future acquisitions or collaborations are not only valuable but also align with the Board's acquisition guidelines. The company dedicates substantial management time and financial resources to secure the success of newly acquired endeavors. This includes developing local market strategies, addressing potential cultural and language barriers, and integrating business practices to ensure the overall viability of the business.</td>

<td>Failure to adapt to changing consumer health trends and address misconceptions about the health effects of soft drink consumption may adversely affect demand.</td>

to assess the environmental impacts and embed the principles of sustainability into various stages of product
i.e, procurement of raw material, manufacturing of products, transportation of raw materials and supply of
finished goods. In order to continuously reduce the Company environmental footprint, the Company is improving
efficiencies, especially on critical resources such as water, fuel and energy, optimizing the resource consumption
and minimizing wastages including plastic waste management, increasing green cover in manufacturing plants
and also developing outside establishments.

10\. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy
adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes
and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.

We do segregation of all type of waste at source and store wastes in designated areas only. Wastages are closely
monitored on daily, weekly and monthly basis and are directly linked with plant KPIs. Approximately more than 90-98%
waste (broken glass, plastic bottles, cartons, metal waste etc) goes for recycling. Unit has effective ETP operation
combined with aeration and anaerobic system wherein effective operational controls ensures very limited quantity of
ETP sludge generation as a hazardous waste. ETP sludge is safely collected in Hazardous waste storage area and finally
disposal is done to pollution control board approved TSDF facility for landfill. Unit is not using any toxic chemicals.

Essential Indicators

1\. Describe the mechanisms in place to receive and respond to consumer complaints and feedback

VBL Consumer response programme is developed to promptly resolve consumer concerns & grievances, which
ensures that consumer/ customer is responded with courtesy and in timely manner. The Mechanism helps the
organization to remain consumer centric, establish top down approach to build trust and strengthen transparency
while addressing their queries and concerns:

The Complaints are lodged by consumer (via Toll Free no. available on label & crown), arranged and sorted by the
PepsiCo Consumer Response System (CRS) representative who then, forwards the same to VBL after logging in
on Wilke portal. VBL Plant team & Consumer Care / Complaint Management System (CCMS) coordinator review
auto generated email containing relevant details of the Complaint which are then investigated by VBL Plant team,
Regional Quality Coordinator (RQC) & CCMS coordinator and the complaint is attended by Customer Relationship
Executive (CRE) to address the concern simultaneously. After detailed analysis of each reported complaints by all
the plants root cause analysis is carried out and Corrective and Preventive Actions are taken by plant team.

Plants then, initiate an improvement plan to mitigate reoccurrence of concern and to pacify & satisfy the consumer.

Feedback:

Feedback is sent to PepsiCo CRS team by CCMS coordinator and Pepsi International (PI) Team connects & respond
to consumer, subsequently on SOS basis.

The Complaints in VBL are tracked and reviewed monthly on the basis of it's nature, flavour, category and plant.

express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated
financial statements, our responsibility is to read the
other information and, in doing so, consider whether
the other information is materially inconsistent
with the consolidated financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise
appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the
work we have performed, we conclude that there is a
material misstatement of this other information, we
are required to report that fact. We have nothing to
report in this regard.


### Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements

7\. The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been approved by the Holding Company's
Board of Directors. The Holding Company's Board
of Directors are responsible for the matters stated
in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the
preparation and presentation of these consolidated

financial statements that give a true and fair view of the
consolidated financial position, consolidated financial
performance including other comprehensive income,
consolidated changes in equity and consolidated
cash flows of the Group including its associates and
joint venture in accordance with the Ind AS specified
under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, and
other accounting principles generally accepted in
India. The Holding Company's Board of Directors are
also responsible for ensuring accuracy of records
including financial information considered necessary
for the preparation of consolidated Ind AS financial
statements. Further, in terms of the provisions of
the Act the respective Board of Directors of the
companies included in the Group, and its associate
companies and joint venture company covered
under the Act are responsible for maintenance of
adequate accounting records in accordance with the
provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of
the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds
and other irregularities; selection and application of
appropriate accounting policies; making judgments
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
and design, implementation and maintenance of
adequate internal financial controls, that were
operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and
completeness of the accounting records, relevant
to the preparation and presentation of the financial
statements that give a true and fair view and are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud
or error. These financial statements have been used
for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated
financial statements by the Board of Directors of the
Holding Company, as aforesaid.

8\. In preparing the consolidated financial statements,
the respective Board of Directors of the companies
included in the Group and of its associates and
joint venture are responsible for assessing the
ability of the Group and of its associates and joint
venture to continue as a going concern, disclosing,
as applicable, matters related to going concern and
using the going concern basis of accounting unless
the Board of Directors either intend to liquidate the
Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic
alternative but to do so.

9\. Those respective Board of Directors are also
responsible for overseeing the financial reporting
process of the companies included in the Group and
of its associates and joint venture


### Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

10\. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the consolidated financial statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an
auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with Standards on Auditing will always detect a
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements
can arise from fraud or error and are considered
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they
could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these consolidated financial statements.

11\.
As part of an audit in accordance with Standards
on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the
Act we exercise professional judgment and maintain
professional skepticism throughout the audit.
We also:

. Identify and assess the risks of material
misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error,
design and perform audit procedures responsive
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a
material misstatement resulting from fraud
is higher than for one resulting from error, as
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override
of internal control;

· Obtain an understanding of internal control
relevant to the audit in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the
Act we are also responsible for expressing
our opinion on whether the Holding Company
has adequate internal financial controls with
reference to financial statements in place and
the operating effectiveness of such controls .;

· Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting
policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures
made by management;

· Conclude on the appropriateness of Board of
Directors' use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast
significant doubt on the ability of the Group and
its associates and joint venture to continue as a
going concern. If we conclude that a material
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw
attention in our auditor's report to the related
disclosures in the financial statements or, if
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's
report. However, future events or conditions
may cause the Group and its associates and
joint venture to cease to continue as a going
concern;

· Evaluate the overall presentation, structure
and content of the financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the
financial statements represent the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that
achieves fair presentation; and

· Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence
regarding the financial statements of the
entities or business activities within the
Group, and its associates and joint venture,
to express an opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. We are responsible for the
direction, supervision and performance of the
audit of financial statements of such entities
included in the financial statements, of which
we are the independent auditors. For the other
entities included in the financial statements,

<!-- PageFooter="Varun Beverages Limited" -->
<!-- PageNumber="230" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="FINANCIAL STATEMENTS" -->
<!-- PageHeader="STATUTORY REPORTS" -->
<!-- PageHeader="CORPORATE OVERVIEW" -->

which have been audited by the other auditors,
such other auditors remain responsible for the
direction, supervision and performance of the
audits carried out by them. We remain solely
responsible for our audit opinion.

12\. We communicate with those charged with
governance regarding, among other matters, the
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies
in internal control that we identify during our audit.

13\. We also provide those charged with governance with
a statement that we have complied with relevant
ethical requirements regarding independence, and
to communicate with them all relationships and
other matters that may reasonably be thought to
bear on our independence, and where applicable,
related safeguards.

14\. From the matters communicated with those charged
with governance, we determine those matters that
were of most significance in the audit of the financial
statements of the current period and are therefore
the key audit matters. We describe these matters
in our auditor's report unless law or regulation
precludes public disclosure about the matter or
when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine
that a matter should not be communicated in our
report because the adverse consequences of doing
so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the
public interest benefits of such communication.

## Annexure II


### Independent Auditor's Report on the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated financial statements under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act')

1\.
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated
financial statements of Varun Beverages Limited ('the
Holding Company') and its subsidiaries (the Holding
Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as
'the Group'), its associates and joint venture as at
and for the year ended 31 December 2024, we have
audited the internal financial controls with reference
to financial statements of the Holding Company, its
subsidiary company, its associate companies and
joint venture company, which are companies covered
under the Act, as at that date.


#### Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for Internal Financial Controls

2\. The respective Board of Directors of the Holding
Company, its subsidiary company, its associate
companies and joint venture company, which are
companies covered under the Act, are responsible
for establishing and maintaining internal financial
controls based on the internal financial controls
with reference to financial statements criteria
established by the Company considering the
essential components of internal control stated in
the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial
Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These
responsibilities include the design, implementation
and maintenance of adequate internal financial
controls that were operating effectively for ensuring
the orderly and efficient conduct of the Company's
business, including adherence to the Company's
policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention
and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and
completeness of the accounting records, and the
timely preparation of reliable financial information,
as required under the Act.


#### Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements

3\. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the internal financial controls with reference to
financial statements of the Holding Company, its
subsidiary company, its associate companies and
joint venture company, as aforesaid, based on our
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with

the Standards on Auditing issued by the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of India ('ICAl') prescribed
under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent
applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with
reference to financial statements, and the Guidance
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over
Financial Reporting ('the Guidance Note') issued by
the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note
require that we comply with ethical requirements
and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether adequate internal financial
controls with reference to financial statements were
established and maintained and if such controls
operated effectively in all material respects.

4\.
Our audit involves performing procedures to
obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the
internal financial controls with reference to financial
statements and their operating effectiveness. Our
audit of internal financial controls with reference
to financial statements includes obtaining an
understanding of such internal financial controls,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,
and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on
the auditor's judgement, including the assessment
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error.

5\.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained
and the audit evidence obtained by the other
auditors in terms of their reports referred to in the
Other Matter paragraph below, is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion
on the internal financial controls with reference to
financial statements of the Holding Company, its
subsidiary company and joint venture company as
aforesaid.


#### Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements

6\. A company's internal financial controls with reference
to financial statements is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance

<!-- PageFooter="Annual Report 2024 237" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->


<figure>

VB
VARUN BEVERAGES

</figure>


with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company's internal financial controls with reference
to financial statements include those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorisations of
management and directors of the company; and (3)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use,
or disposition of the company's assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.


## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements

7\. Because of the inherent limitations of internal
financial controls with reference to financial
statements, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and
not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation
of the internal financial controls with reference to
financial statements to future periods are subject
to the risk that the internal financial controls with
reference to financial statements may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.


## Opinion

8\. In our opinion and based on the consideration of
the reports of the other auditor on internal financial
controls with reference to financial statements of
the subsidiary company and joint venture company,
the Holding Company its subsidiary company, and
joint venture company which are companies covered
under the Act, have in all material respects, adequate
internal financial controls with reference to financial
statements and such controls were operating

effectively as at 31 December 2024, based on the
internal financial controls with reference to financial
statements criteria established by the Company
considering the essential components of internal
control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of
Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of
India.


## Other Matter

9\. We did not audit the internal financial controls with
reference to financial statements insofar as it relates
to one subsidiary company, which is company
covered under the Act, whose financial statements
reflect total assets of ₹ 2,906.75 million and net assets
of ₹ 2,041.21 million as at 31 December 2024 , total
revenues of ₹ 1,729.54 million and net cash outflows
amounting to ₹ (81.91) million for the year ended on
that date, as considered in the consolidated financial
statements. The consolidated financial statements
also include the Group's share of net loss (including
other comprehensive loss) of ₹ 12.50 million for the
year ended 31 December 2024, in respect of one
joint venture company, which is company covered
under the Act, whose internal financial controls
with reference to financial statements have not
been audited by us. The internal financial controls
with reference to financial statements in so far as it
relates to such subsidiary company and joint venture
company have been audited by one of the joint
auditors, O P Bagla & Co LLP whose reports have
been furnished to us by the management and our
report on the adequacy and operating effectiveness
of the internal financial controls with reference to
financial statements for the Holding Company its
subsidiary company and joint venture company, as
aforesaid, under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act in so
far as it relates to such subsidiary company and joint
venture company is based solely on the reports of
the O P Bagla & Co LLP. Our opinion is not modified
in respect of this matter with respect to our reliance
on the work done by and on the report of the
O P Bagla & Co LLP.

10\. We did not audit the internal financial controls
with reference to financial statements in so far as
it relates to two associate companies, which are
companies covered under the Act, in respect of
which, the Group's share of net loss (including
other comprehensive loss) of ₹ 2.28 million for
the year ended 31 December 2024 has been
considered in the consolidated financial statements.
The internal financial controls with reference to
financial statements of these associate companies,
which are companies covered under the Act, are
unaudited and our opinion under Section 143(3)(i)
of the Act on adequacy and operating effectiveness
of the internal financial controls with reference

to financial statements insofar as it relates to the
aforesaid associates, which are companies covered
under the Act, is solely based on the corresponding
internal financial controls with reference to financial
statements reports certified by the management
of such companies. In our opinion and according
to the information and explanations given to us by
the management, these financial information are not
material to the Group. Our opinion is not modified

## Summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information on the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024

All amounts disclosed in the CFS and notes have
been rounded off to the nearest million as per the
requirement of Schedule III to the Act, unless otherwise
stated.


### 2.1. Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements comprise the
financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries
and associate. Control is achieved when the Group
is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its
involvement with the investee and has the ability
to affect those returns through its power over the
investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if
and only if the Group has:

· Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that
give it the current ability to direct the relevant
activities of the investee);

· Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its
involvement with the investee, and

· The ability to use its power over the investee to
affect its returns.

Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting
rights result in control. To support this presumption and
when the Group has less than a majority of the voting
or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all
relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether
it has power over an investee, including:

a) The contractual arrangement with the other vote
holders of the investee;

b)
The rights arising from other contractual
arrangements;

c)
The Group's voting rights and potential voting
rights; and

d)
The size of the Group's holding of voting rights
relative to the size and dispersion of the holdings
of the other voting rights holders.

The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an
investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there
are changes to one or more of the three elements of
control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when
the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and
ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary.
Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary
acquired or disposed of during the year are included
in the consolidated financial statements from the date
the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases
to control the subsidiary.

Consolidated financial statements are prepared using
uniform accounting policies for like transactions and
other events in similar circumstances. If a member of
the Group uses accounting policies other than those
adopted in the consolidated financial statements for
like transactions and events in similar circumstances,
appropriate adjustments are made to that member's
financial statements in preparing the consolidated
financial statements to ensure conformity with the
Group's accounting policies.

An associate is an entity over which the Group has
significant influence, i.e., the power to participate in the
financial and operating policy decisions of the investee
but not control or joint control over those policies.

The financial statements of all entities used for the
purpose of consolidation are drawn up to same
reporting date as that of the parent company, i.e.,
year ended 31 December. When the end of the
reporting period of the parent is different from that
of a subsidiary/ associate, the subsidiary/ associate
prepares, for consolidation purposes, additional
financial information as of the same date as the
financial statements of the parent to enable the
parent to consolidate the financial information of the
subsidiary, unless it is impracticable to do so.

The following consolidation procedures are adopted:
Subsidiary

a)
Combine like items of assets, liabilities, equity,
income, expenses and cash flows of the parent with
those of its subsidiaries. For this purpose, income
and expenses of the subsidiary are based on the
amounts of the assets and liabilities recognised
in the consolidated financial statements at the
acquisition date;

b)
Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of the
parent's investment in each subsidiary and the
parent's portion of equity of each subsidiary.
Business combinations policy explains how to
account for any related goodwill; and

c)
Eliminate in full intragroup assets and liabilities,
equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating
to transactions between entities of the group
(profits or losses resulting from intragroup
transactions that are recognised in assets, such as
inventory and fixed assets, are eliminated in full).
Ind AS 12 'Income Taxes' applies to temporary
differences that arise from the elimination of
profits and losses resulting from intragroup
transactions.

## Summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information on the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024

Profit or loss and each component of Other
Comprehensive Income ("OCI") are attributed to the
equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the
non-controlling interests, even if this results in the
non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without
a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction.
If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:

· Derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and
liabilities of the subsidiary;

. Derecognises the carrying amount of any
non-controlling interests;

. Derecognises the cumulative translation
differences recorded in equity;

· Recognises the fair value of the consideration
received;

· Recognises the fair value of any investment
retained;

· Recognises any surplus or deficit in Consolidated
Statement of Profit and Loss;

· Reclassifies the parent's share of components
previously recognised in OCI to profit or loss or
retained earnings, as appropriate, as would be
required if the Group had directly disposed of the
related assets or liabilities


### Associates/Joint Venture

Interests in associates/joint venture are accounted for
using the equity method, after initially being recognised
at cost in the consolidated balance sheet. When a
member of the Group transacts with an associate of
the Group, profits and losses from transactions with
the associate/joint venture are recognised in the CFS
only to the extent of interests in the associate/joint
venture that are not related to the Group.

The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to
recognise changes in the Group's share of net assets of
the associate/joint venture since the acquisition date.
Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the
carrying amount of the investment.

The Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss reflects
the Group's share of the results of operations of the
associate/joint venture. Any change in OCI of those
investees is presented as part of the Group's OCI. In
addition, when there has been a change recognised
directly in the equity of the associate/joint venture,

the Group recognises its share of any changes,
when applicable, in the statement of changes in
equity. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from
transactions between the Group and the associate/
joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the
interest in the associate/joint venture. The aggregate
of the Group's share of profit or loss of an associate/
joint venture is shown on the face of the Consolidated
Statement of Profit and Loss.

After application of the equity method, the Group
determines whether it is necessary to recognise an
impairment loss on its investment in its associate/joint
venture. At each reporting date, the Group determines
whether there is objective evidence that the investment
in the associate/joint venture is impaired. If there is
such evidence, the Group calculates the amount of
impairment as the difference between the recoverable
amount of the associate/joint venture and its carrying
value, and then recognises the loss as 'Share of loss
of associates and joint venture' in the Consolidated
Statement of Profit and Loss.

Upon loss of significant influence over the associate/
joint venture, the Group measures and recognises any
retained investment at its fair value. Any difference
between the carrying amount of the associate/joint
venture upon loss of significant and the fair value of
the retained investment and proceeds from disposal
is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of
Profit and Loss.

On acquisition of control over previously owned
associates, the Group re-measures its previously held
equity interest in the associates at the acquisition
date fair value and the difference, if any, between the
carrying amount and the fair value is recognised in the
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

Goodwill is generally computed as the difference
between the sum of consideration transferred
(measured at the fair value) the non-controlling interest
("'NCI") in the acquire and the net of the acquisition
date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and
the liabilities assumed.


#### 3. Summary of material accounting policies


##### a) Fair value measurements

The Group measures financial instruments
at fair value which is the price that would be
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer

## Summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information on the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024

a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date.
The fair value measurement is based on the
presumption that the transaction to sell the
asset or transfer the liability takes place either:

. In the principal market for the asset or
liability, or

· In the absence of a principal market, in the
most advantageous market for the asset or
liability.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is
measured or disclosed in the consolidated financial
statements are categorised within the fair value
hierarchy, described as follows, based on the
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement as a whole:

· Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

· Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the
lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement is directly or indirectly
observable; and

· Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the
lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement is unobservable.

The Group uses valuation techniques that are
appropriate in the circumstances and for which
sufficient data are available to measure fair value,
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and
minimising the use of unobservable inputs. For assets
and liabilities that are recognised in the consolidated
financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group
determines whether transfers have occurred between
levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation
(based on the lowest level input that is significant to
the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of
each reporting period.

For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group
has determined classes of assets and liabilities on
the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of
the asset or liability and the level of the fair value
hierarchy as explained above.


### b) Revenue recognition

Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control
of promised goods or services to customers
at an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the Group is expected to be entitled

to in exchange for those goods or services.
Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance
obligation is measured at the amount of
transaction price (net of variable considerations)
allocated to that performance obligation as per
contractually agreed terms with the customers.
The transaction price of goods sold and services
rendered is net of variable considerations on
account of various discounts and schemes
offered by the Company as part of the contract.
Revenue is recorded provided the recovery of
consideration is probable and determinable.
Revenue from sale of goods and services
transferred to distributors/intermediaries are
recognised at a point in time.


#### Sale of goods

Revenue from the sale of manufactured and
traded goods products is recognised upon
transfer of control of products to the customers
which coincides with their delivery to customer
and is measured at fair value of consideration
received/receivable, net of discounts, amount
collected on behalf of third parties and
applicable taxes.


#### Interest income

Interest income is recognised on time
proportion basis taking into account the amount
outstanding and rate applicable. For all debt
instruments measured at amortised cost, interest
income is recorded using the effective interest
rate ("EIR"). EIR is the rate that exactly discounts
the estimated future cash payments or receipts
over the expected life of the financial instrument
or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the
gross carrying amount of the financial assets.
Interest income is included in finance income in
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.


#### Dividends

Dividend is recognised when the Group's right
to receive the payment is established, which
is generally when shareholders approve the
dividend.


#### Services rendered

Revenue from service related activities including
management and technical know-how service,
job work are recognised as and when services
are rendered and on the basis of contractual
terms with the parties.

c) Inventories

Inventories are valued as follows:

i. Raw materials, components and stores and
spares: At lower of cost and net realisable
value. Cost of inventory comprises all costs
of purchases, duties, taxes (other than
those subsequently recoverable from tax
authorities) and all other costs incurred
in bringing the inventory to their present
location and condition and is determined
on a moving weighted average cost basis.
However, materials and other items held
for use in the production of inventories are
not written down below cost if the finished
products in which they will be incorporated
are expected to be sold at or above cost.

ii.
Work-in-progress: At lower of cost and
net realisable value. Cost for this purpose
includes material, labour and appropriate
allocation of overheads including
depreciation. Cost is determined on a
weighted average basis.

iii. Intermediate goods/ Finished goods:

a)
Self-manufactured - At lower of cost
and net realisable value. Cost for this
purpose includes material, labour and
appropriate allocation of overheads.
Cost is determined on a weighted
average basis.

b)
Traded - At lower of cost and net
realisable value. Cost of inventory
comprises all costs of purchases, duties,
taxes (other than those subsequently
recoverable from tax authorities) and
all other costs incurred in bringing
the inventory to their present location
and condition and is determined on a
weighted average cost basis.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling
price in the ordinary course of business, less
estimated costs of completion and estimated
costs necessary to make the sale. Provision
for obsolescence is determined based on
management's assessment and is charged to the
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.


### d) Property, plant and equipment Measurement at recognition

Property, plant and equipment and capital work
in progress is stated at cost, net of accumulated
depreciation and accumulated impairment
losses, if any.

Cost comprises the purchase price, borrowing
costs if capitalization criteria are met and any
directly attributable cost of bringing the asset
to its working condition for the intended use.
Any trade discounts and rebates are deducted
in arriving at the purchase price. The cost of
an item of property, plant and equipment is
recognised as an asset if, and only if:

a.
it is probable that future economic benefits
associated with the item will flow to the
entity; and

b.
the cost of the item can be measured
reliably.

Subsequent expenditure related to an item of
property, plant and equipment is added to its
book value only if it increased the future benefits
from the existing asset beyond its previously
assessed standard of performance. All other
expenses on existing assets, including day-
to- day repair and maintenance expenditure
and cost of replacing parts, are charged to
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss
for the period during which such expenses
are incurred. Expenditure directly relating to
construction activity is capitalized. Indirect
expenditure incurred during construction period
is capitalized as a part of indirect construction
cost to the extent the expenditure is related
to construction or is incidental thereto. Other
indirect costs incurred during-the construction
periods which are not related to construction
activity nor are incidental thereto are charged to
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

Value for individual assets acquired for a
consolidated price, the consideration is
apportioned to the various assets on a fair value
basis as determined by competent valuers

## Summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information on the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024


### Depreciation

The management has estimated, supported by
technical assessment, the useful lives of property,
plant and equipment. The management believes that
these estimated useful lives are realistic and reflect
fair approximation of the period over which the
assets are likely to be used. Depreciation is calculated
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives
of the assets as follows:


<table>
<tr>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Useful lives (upto)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Leasehold land</td>
<td>Over lease period</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Buildings-factory</td>
<td>20-50 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Buildings-others</td>
<td>59-60 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Plant and equipment</td>
<td>4-20 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Furniture and fixtures</td>
<td>5-10 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Delivery vehicles</td>
<td>4-10 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Vehicles (other than delivery vehicles)</td>
<td>4-7 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Office equipment</td>
<td>4-10 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Computer equipment</td>
<td>3-5 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Containers</td>
<td>4-10 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Post-mix vending machines and refrigerators (Visi - Cooler)</td>
<td>5-10 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Power generating assets*</td>
<td>22 years</td>
</tr>
</table>

*included in plant and equipment in financial statements.


Freehold land is not depreciated.

Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is
provided over the useful life of assets as specified in
Schedule II to the Act except where the management,
based on independent technical assessment,
depreciates certain assets are over estimated
useful lives which are different from the useful life
prescribed in the Schedule II to the Act.

The Group has used the remaining useful lives to
compute depreciation on its property, plant and
equipment, acquired under the business transfer
agreement based on external technical evaluation.

Depreciation on property, plant and equipment
which are added/disposed off during the year is
provided on a pro-rata basis with reference to the
month of addition/deletion.

The Group has technically evaluated all the property,
plant and equipment for determining the separate
identifiable assets having different useful lives
under the component approach. On technical
evaluation of all separate identifiable components,
the management is of the opinion that they do
not have any different useful life from that of the
principal asset.

In case of revaluation of leasehold land, the resulting
amortisation of the total revalued amount is expensed
off to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.


### Derecognition

An item of property, plant and equipment and any
significant part initially recognised is de-recognised
upon disposal or when no future economic benefits
are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or
loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated
as the difference between the net disposal proceeds
or amount of security deposit adjusted and the
carrying amount of the asset) is included in the
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when the
asset is de-recognised.

Breakages of containers are adjusted on 'first
bought first broken' basis, since it is not feasible
to specifically identify the broken containers in the
fixed assets records


#### e) Intangible assets

Intangible assets are initially recognised at:

a.
In case the assets are acquired separately,
then at cost,

b.
In case the assets are acquired in a business
combination or under any asset purchase
agreement, at fair value.

Following initial recognition, intangible assets are
carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation
and accumulated impairment losses.

Intangible assets with finite useful life are assessed
for impairment whenever there is an indication
that the intangible assets may be impaired.

Amortisation of other intangible assets are
amortised on a straight-line basis using the
estimated useful life as follows:


<table>
<tr>
<th>Intangible assets</th>
<th>Useful lives (years)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Software</td>
<td>3-5 Years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Market infrastructure</td>
<td>5-15 Years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Distribution network</td>
<td>6-10 Years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Brands</td>
<td>10 Years</td>
</tr>
</table>

have a remaining legal life of not exceeding
ten years but is renewable every ten years at
little cost and is well established. The Group
intends to renew these rights continuously
and evidence supports its ability to do so. An
analysis of product life cycle studies, market
and competitive trends provides evidence that
the product will generate net cash inflows for
the Group for an indefinite period. Therefore,
these rights have been carried at cost without
amortisation, but is tested for impairment
annually, at the cash-generating unit level.
The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed
annually to determine whether the indefinite life
continues to be supportable. If not, the change
in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on
a prospective basis.


### f) Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs include interest, amortisation
of ancillary costs incurred in connection with
the arrangement of borrowings and exchange
differences arising from foreign currency
borrowings to the extent they are regarded as
an adjustment to the interest cost. Borrowing
costs, if any, directly attributable to the
acquisition, construction or production of an
asset that necessarily takes a substantial period
of time to get ready for its intended use or sale
are capitalized, if any. All other borrowing costs
are expensed to the Consolidated Statement of
Profit and Loss in the period in which they occur.


### g) Leases


#### The Group as a lessee

The Group enters into an arrangement for lease
of buildings and equipments. Such arrangements
are generally for a fixed period but may have
extension or termination options. In accordance
with Ind AS 116 - Leases, at inception of the
contract, the Group assesses whether a contract
is, or contains a lease. A lease is defined as 'a
contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the
right to control the use an asset (the underlying
asset) for a period of time in exchange for
consideration'.

To assess whether a contract conveys the right
to control the use of an identified asset, the
Group assesses whether:

· The contract involves the use of an identified
asset - this may be specified explicitly or
implicitly, and should be physically distinct or
represent substantially all of the capacity of a
physically distinct asset. If the supplier has a
substantive substitution right, then the asset is
not identified;

· The Group has the right to obtain substantially
all of the economic benefits from use of the
asset throughout the period of use; and

· The Group assesses whether it has the right
to direct 'how and for what purpose' the
asset is used throughout the period of use.
At inception or on reassessment of a contract
that contains a lease component, the Group
allocates the consideration in the contract to
each lease component on the basis of their
relative stand-alone prices. However, for the
leases of land and buildings in which it is a
lessee, the Group has elected not to separate
non-lease components and account for the
lease and non-lease components as a single
lease component.


#### Measurement and recognition of leases as a lessee

The Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a
lease liability at the lease commencement date. The
right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which
comprises the initial amount of the lease liability
adjusted for any lease payments made at or before
the commencement date, plus any initial direct
costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle
and remove the underlying asset or to restore the
underlying asset or the site on which it is located,
less any lease incentives received.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at
cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated
impairment losses (unless such right of use assets
fulfills the requirements of Ind AS 40 - Investment
Property and is accounted for as there under), if any
and adjusted for any re-measurement of the lease
liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using
the straight-line method from the commencement
date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of
right-of-use asset. Right-of-use assets are tested
for impairment whenever there is any indication
that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

<!-- PageHeader="STATUTORY REPORTS" -->
<!-- PageHeader="CORPORATE OVERVIEW" -->


## Summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information on the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024

The lease liability is initially measured at the present
value of the lease payments that are not paid at the
commencement date, discounted using the interest
rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily
determined, the Group's incremental borrowing rate.
Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing
rate as the discount rate.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the
lease liability comprise the following:

· Fixed payments, including in-substance fixed
payments;

· Variable lease payments that depend on an
index or a rate, initially measured using the
index or rate as at the commencement date;

· Amounts expected to be payable under a
residual value guarantee; and

· The exercise price under a purchase option that
the Group is reasonably certain to exercise,
lease payments in an optional renewal period
if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise
an extension option, and penalties for early
termination of a lease unless the Group is
reasonably certain not to terminate early.

The lease liability is measured at amortized cost using
the effective interest rate method. It is remeasured
when there is a change in future lease payments
arising from a change in an index or rate, if there
is a change in the Group's estimate of the amount
expected to be payable under a residual value
guarantee, or if the Group changes its assessment
of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension
or termination option. When the lease liability is
remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment
is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use
asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying
amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced
to zero, as the case may be.

The Group presents right-of-use assets that do not
meet the definition of investment property and lease
liabilities as a separate line item in the standalone
financial statements of the Group.

The Group has elected not to apply the requirements
of Ind AS 116 - Leases to short-term leases of all
assets that have a lease term of 12 months or less and
leases for which the underlying asset is of low value.

The lease payments associated with these leases are
recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis
over the lease term.


### The Group as a lessor

When the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at
lease inception whether each lease is a finance
lease or an operating lease. To classify each lease,
the Group makes an overall assessment of whether
the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and
rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying
asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance
lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part
of this assessment, the Group considers certain
indicators such as whether the lease is for the major
part of the economic life of the asset.

When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts
for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease
separately. It assesses the lease classification of a
sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset
arising from the head lease, not with reference to
the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term
lease to which the Group applies the exemption
described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as
an operating lease.

The Group recognizes lease payments received
under operating leases as income on a straight-line
basis over the lease term as part of 'other income'.

The accounting policies applicable to the Group as a
lessor in the comparative period were not different
from Ind AS 116 - Leases. However, when the Group
was an intermediate lessor the sub-leases were
classified with reference to the underlying asset.

The Group recognizes lease payments received
under operating leases as income on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. In case of a finance lease,
finance income is recognised over the lease term
based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate
of return on the lessor's net investment in the lease.
When the Group is an intermediate lessor it accounts
for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease
separately. It assesses the lease classification of a
sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset
arising from the head lease, not with reference to
the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short term
lease to which the Group applies the exemption
described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as
an operating lease.

### h) Employee benefits

Contribution to provident and other funds

Retirement benefit in the form of provident
fund is a defined contribution scheme. The
Group has no obligation, other than the
contribution payable to the provident fund.
The Group recognises contribution payable
to the provident fund scheme as an expense,
when an employee renders the related service.
If the contribution payable to the scheme for
service received before the balance sheet date
exceeds the contribution already paid, the
deficit payable to the scheme is recognised
as a liability after deducting the contribution
already paid. If the contribution already paid
exceeds the contribution due for services
received before the balance sheet date, then
excess is recognised as an asset to the extent
that the pre-payment will lead to, for example, a
reduction in future payment or a cash refund.


#### Gratuity

Gratuity is a defined benefit scheme. The
cost of providing benefits under the defined
benefit plan is determined using the projected
unit credit method. The Group recognises
termination benefit as a liability and an expense
when the Group has a present obligation as a
result of past event, it is probable that an outflow
of resources embodying economic benefits
will be required to settle the obligation and a
reliable estimate can be made of the amount
of the obligation. If the termination benefits fall
due more than twelve months after the balance
sheet date, they are measured at present value
of future cash flows using the discount rate
determined by reference to market yields at the
balance sheet date on government bonds.

Gratuity liability is accrued on the basis of
an actuarial valuation made at the end of the
year. The actuarial valuation is performed
by an independent actuary as per projected
unit credit method, except for few subsidiary
companies where gratuity liability is provided
on full cost basis.

Re-measurements, comprising actuarial gains
and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling,

excluding amounts included in net interest on
the net defined benefit liability and the return
on plan assets (excluding amounts included in
net interest on the net defined benefit liability),
are recognised immediately in the balance sheet
with a corresponding debit or credit to retained
earnings through OCI in the period in which they
occur. Re-measurements are not reclassified to
profit or loss in subsequent periods.

Past service costs are recognised in Consolidated
Statement of Profit and Loss on the earlier of:

· The date of the plan amendment or
curtailment, and

· The date that the Group recognises related
restructuring cost

Net interest is calculated by applying the
discount rate to the net defined benefit liability
or asset.

The Group recognises the following changes in
the net defined benefit obligation as an expense
in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and
Loss:

· Service costs comprising current service
costs, past-service costs, gains and
losses on curtailments and non-routine
settlements; and

. Net interest expense or income


#### Compensated absences

The Group treats accumulated leave expected
to be carried forward beyond twelve months,
as long-term employee benefit which are
computed based on the actuarial valuation using
the projected unit credit method at the year
end except for few subsidiary companies where
accumulated leave liability is provided on full cost
basis. Actuarial gains/losses are immediately
taken to the Consolidated Statement of Profit
and Loss and are not deferred. The Group
presents the leave as a current liability in the
balance sheet to the extent it does not have
an unconditional right to defer its settlement
for twelve months after the reporting date.
Where Group has the unconditional legal and

## Summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information on the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024

contractual right to defer the settlement for a
period beyond twelve months, the balance is
presented as a non-current liability.

Accumulated leave, which is expected to be
utilized within the next twelve months, is treated
as short term employee benefit. The Group
measures the expected cost of such absences
as the additional amount that it expects to pay
as a result of the unused entitlement that has
accumulated at the reporting date.

All other employee benefits payable/available
within twelve months of rendering the service
are classified as short-term employee benefits.
Benefits such as salaries, wages, bonus, etc.
are recognised in the Consolidated Statement
of Profit and Loss in the period in which the
employee renders the related service.


### i) Share-based payments

Employees (including senior executives)
of the Group receive remuneration in the
form of share-based payments, whereby
employees render services as consideration
for equity instruments which are classified as
equity-settled transactions.

The cost of equity-settled transactions is
determined by the fair value at the date of grant
using an appropriate valuation model. That cost
is recognised as an employee benefit expense
with a corresponding increase in 'Share option
outstanding account' in other equity, over the
period in which the performance and/or service
conditions are fulfilled in relation to options
granted to employees of the Group.

The cumulative expense recognised for
equity-settled transactions at each reporting
date until the vesting date reflects the extent
to which the vesting period has expired and the
parent company's best estimate of the number
of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.

Service and non-market performance
conditions are not taken into account when
determining the grant date fair value of awards,
but the likelihood of the conditions being met is
assessed as part of the parent company's best

estimate of the number of equity instruments
that will ultimately vest. Market performance
conditions are reflected within the grant date
fair value. Any other conditions attached to
an award, but without an associated service
requirement, are considered to be non-vesting
conditions.

Non-vesting conditions are reflected in the fair
value of an award and lead to an immediate
expensing of an award unless there are also
service and/or performance conditions.

No expense is recognised for awards that
do not ultimately vest because non-market
performance and/or service conditions have
not been met. Where awards include a market
or non-vesting condition, the transactions are
treated as vested irrespective of whether the
market or non-vesting condition is satisfied,
provided that all other performance and/or
service conditions are satisfied.

When the terms of an equity-settled award are
modified, the minimum expense recognised
is the expense had the terms had not been
modified, if the original terms of the award are
met. An additional expense is recognised for
any modification that increases the total fair
value of the share-based payment transaction,
or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as
measured at the date of modification. Where an
award is cancelled by the parent company or by
the counterparty, any remaining element of the
fair value of the award is expensed immediately
through the Statement of Profit and Loss.

The dilutive effect of outstanding options is
reflected as additional share dilution in the
computation of diluted earnings per share.


### j) Foreign currency transactions and translations

The Group's consolidated financial statements
are presented in INR, which is also the parent
company's functional currency. Transactions in
foreign currencies are initially recorded by the
Group's entities at their respective functional
currency spot rates at the date the transaction
first qualifies for recognition. However, for
practical reasons, the Group uses an average

## Summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information on the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024

rate if the average approximates the actual rate
at the date of the transaction.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated
in foreign currencies are translated at the
functional currency spot rates of exchange at the
reporting date. Non-monetary items which are
carried in terms of historical cost denominated
in a foreign currency are reported using the
exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement
of monetary items or on restatement of the
Company's monetary items at rates different
from those at which they were initially recorded
during the year, or reported in previous financial
statements, are recognised as income or as
expenses in the year in which they arise.

Exchange differences pertaining to long-term
foreign currency monetary items obtained or
given on or after 01 January 2017: Exchange
differences arising on conversion of long term
foreign currency monetary items obtained or
given is recorded in the Consolidated Statement
of Profit and Loss.


### Group companies

On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of
foreign operations are translated into INR at
the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting
date and their statements of profit and loss are
translated at exchange rates prevailing at the
dates of the transactions. For practical reasons,
the group uses an average rate to translate
income and expense items, if the average rate
approximates the exchange rates at the dates of
the transactions.

The exchange differences arising on translation
for consolidation are recognised in OCI. On
disposal of a foreign operation, the component
of OCI relating to that particular foreign
operation is recognised in profit or loss


#### k) Business combinations and goodwill

Business combinations are accounted for
using the acquisition method. The cost of an
acquisition is measured as the aggregate of
the consideration transferred measured at

acquisition date fair value and the amount of
any non-controlling interests in the acquiree.
For each business combination, the Group
elects whether to measure the non-controlling
interests in the acquiree at fair value or at
the proportionate share of the acquiree's
identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs
are expensed as incurred.

At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets
acquired and the liabilities assumed are
recognised at their acquisition date fair values.
For this purpose, the liabilities assumed include
contingent liabilities representing present
obligation and they are measured at their
acquisition fair values irrespective of the fact
that outflow of resources embodying economic
benefits is not probable. However, deferred tax
assets or liabilities, and the assets or liabilities
related to employee benefit arrangements are
recognised and measured in accordance with
Ind AS 12 'Income Taxes' and Ind AS 19 'Employee
Benefits' respectively. When a liability assumed
is recognised at the acquisition date but the
related costs are not deducted in determining
taxable profits until a later period, a deductible
temporary difference arises which results in a
deferred tax asset. A deferred tax asset also
arises when the fair value of an identifiable asset
acquired is less than its tax base.

When the Group acquires a business, it
assesses the financial assets and liabilities
assumed for appropriate classification and
designation in accordance with the contractual
terms, economic circumstances and pertinent
conditions as at the acquisition date.

If the business combination is achieved in
stages, any previously held equity interest is
re-measured at its acquisition date fair value
and any resulting gain or loss is recognised in
profit or loss or OCI, as appropriate.

Any contingent consideration to be transferred
by the acquirer is recognised at fair value at
the acquisition date. Contingent consideration
classified as an asset or liability that is a
financial instrument and within the scope of
Ind AS 109 'Financial Instruments' ("Ind AS

109"), is measured at fair value with changes
in fair value recognised in the Consolidated
Statement of Profit and Loss. If the contingent
consideration is not within the scope of Ind
AS 109, it is measured in accordance with the
appropriate Ind AS. Contingent consideration
that is classified as equity is not re-measured at
subsequent reporting dates and subsequent its
settlement is accounted for within equity.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the
excess of the aggregate of the consideration
transferred and the amount recognised for
non-controlling interests, and any previous
interest held, over the net identifiable assets
acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair
value of the net assets acquired is in excess
of the aggregate consideration transferred,
the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly
identified all of the assets acquired and all
of the liabilities assumed and reviews the
procedures used to measure the amounts
to be recognised at the acquisition date. If
the reassessment still results in an excess of
the fair value of net assets acquired over the
aggregate consideration transferred, then the
gain is recognised in OCI and accumulated in
equity as capital reserve.

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at
cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill
acquired in a business combination is, from
the acquisition date, allocated to each of the
Group's cash-generating units that are expected
to benefit from the combination, irrespective of
whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree
are assigned to those units.

A cash generating unit to which goodwill has
been allocated is tested for impairment annually,
or more frequently when there is an indication
that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable
amount of the cash generating unit is less than
its carrying amount, the impairment loss is
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of
any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to
the other assets of the unit pro rata based on
the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.

Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised
in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is
not reversed in subsequent periods.

Where goodwill has been allocated to a
cash-generating unit and part of the operation
within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill
associated with the disposed operation is
included in the carrying amount of the operation
when determining the gain or loss on disposal.
Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is
measured based on the relative values of the
disposed operation and the portion of the
cash-generating unit retained.

If the initial accounting for a business combination
is incomplete by the end of the reporting period
in which the combination occurs, the Group
reports provisional amounts for the items for
which the accounting is incomplete. Those
provisional amounts are adjusted through
goodwill during the measurement period, or
additional assets or liabilities are recognised,
to reflect new information obtained about facts
and circumstances that existed at the acquisition
date that, if known, would have affected
the amounts recognised at that date. These
adjustments are called as measurement period
adjustments. The measurement period does not
exceed one year from the acquisition date.

Business combinations involving entities that
are controlled by the Group are accounted
for using the 'pooling of interests' method as
follows:

· The assets and liabilities of the combining
entities are reflected at their carrying
amounts;

· Except for adjustments made to harmonise
accounting policies, no adjustments are
made to reflect fair values, or recognise any
new assets or liabilities;

· The balance of the retained earnings
appearing in the financial statements
of the transferor is aggregated with the
corresponding balance appearing in the
financial statements of the transferee or is
adjusted against general reserve; and

<figure>

<!-- PageHeader="V3 WARUN BEVERAGES" -->

</figure>


## Summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information on the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024

· The identity of the reserves is preserved
and the reserves of the transferor become
the reserves of the transferred.

The difference, if any, between the amounts
recorded as share capital issued plus any
additional consideration in the form of cash or
other assets and the amount of share capital of
the transferor is transferred to capital reserve
and is presented separately from other capital
reserves.


### l) Government grants

Grants from the Government are recognised
when there is reasonable assurance that all
underlying conditions will be complied with and
that the grant will be received.

Grants related to income are recognised as
income on a systematic basis in the Statement
of Profit and Loss over the periods necessary to
match them with the related costs, which they
are intended to compensate and are presented
as 'other operating revenues'. Further, where
loans or similar assistance are provided by
Government or related institutions, with an
interest rate below the current applicable
market rate, the effect of this favourable interest
is regarded as a government grant. The loan or
assistance is initially recognised and measured
at fair value and the government grant is
measured as the difference between the initial
carrying value of the loan and the proceeds
to be received. That grant is recognised in
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and
Loss under 'other operating revenue'. The
loan is subsequently measured in the year of
disbursement as per the accounting policy
applicable to financial liabilities.

Government grants related to assets are
presented in the Consolidated balance sheet by
deducting the grant from the carrying value of
the asset and non-monetary grant is recognised
at a nominal value.


#### m) Taxes

Tax expense is the aggregate amount included
in the determination of profit or loss for the
period in respect of current and deferred tax.


##### Current income tax

Current income tax is measured at the amount
expected to be paid to the tax authorities in
accordance with the Income-tax Act, 1961 and
respective local jurisdictions of members of
the Group.

Current income tax assets and liabilities
are measured at the amount expected to
be recovered from or paid to the taxation
authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to
compute the amount are those that are enacted
or substantively enacted, at the reporting date
in the countries where the Group operates and
generates taxable income. Current income tax
relating to items recognised outside profit or
loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either
in OCI or in equity).

Current tax items are recognised in correlation
to the underlying transaction either in OCI or
directly in equity. Management periodically
evaluates positions taken in the tax returns
with respect to situations in which applicable
tax regulations are subject to interpretation
and establishes provisions where appropriate
including amount expected to be paid/
recovered for uncertain tax position.


###### Deferred tax

Deferred tax is provided using the liability
method on temporary differences between
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
book bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured at the tax rates that are expected
to apply in the year when the asset is realised
or the liability is settled, based on tax rates
(and tax laws) that have been enacted or
substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised
outside profit or loss is recognised outside
profit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognised
in correlation to the underlying transaction
either in OCI or directly in equity. Deferred tax
assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a
legally enforceable right exists to set off current
tax assets against current tax liabilities and the
deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity
and the same taxation authority.

<!-- PageHeader="CORPORATE OVERVIEW" -->


## Summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information on the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all
taxable temporary differences except:

· When the deferred tax liability arises
from the initial recognition of goodwill or
an asset or liability in a transaction that
is not a business combination and, at the
time of the transaction, affects neither
the accounting profit nor taxable profit
or loss;

. In respect of taxable temporary
differences associated with investments
in subsidiaries and associate, when the
timing of the reversal of the temporary
differences can be controlled and it is
probable that the temporary differences
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all
deductible temporary differences, the carry
forward of unused tax credits and any unused
tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised to
the extent that it is probable that taxable profit
will be available against which the deductible
temporary differences, and the carry forward of
unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be
utilised, except:

· When the deferred tax asset relating
to the deductible temporary difference
arises from the initial recognition of an
asset or liability in a transaction that is
not a business combination and, at the
time of the transaction, affects neither the
accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss;

. In respect of deductible temporary
differences associated with investments
in subsidiaries and associate, deferred tax
assets are recognised only to the extent
that it is probable that the temporary
differences will reverse in the foreseeable
future and taxable profit will be available
against which the temporary differences
can be utilised.

Deferred income taxes are not provided on the
undistributed earnings of subsidiaries where it
is expected that the earnings of the subsidiary
will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is
reviewed at each reporting date and reduced
to the extent that it is no longer probable that
sufficient taxable profit will be available to
allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to
be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets
are re-assessed at each reporting date and are
recognised to the extent that it has become
probable that future taxable profits will allow
the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

Minimum Alternate Tax ("MAT") credit is
recognised as an asset only when and to the
extent there is convincing evidence that the
relevant members of the Group will pay normal
income tax during the specified period. Such
asset is reviewed at each reporting period end
and the adjusted based on circumstances then
prevailing.

Deferred tax assets are recognised on the
unrealized profit for all the inter-company sale/
purchase eliminations of property, plant and
equipment and inventories.


### Deferred tax on business combination

When a liability assumed is recognized at the
acquisition date but the related costs are not
deducted in determining taxable profits until a
later period, a deductible temporary difference
arises which results in a deferred tax asset. A
deferred tax asset also arises when the fair value
of an identifiable asset acquired is less than its
tax base. In both cases, the resulting deferred
tax asset affects goodwill


### n) Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner
consistent with the internal reporting provided
to the chief operating decision maker, who is
responsible for allocating resources and assessing
performance of the operating segments.

The business activities of the Group
predominantly fall within a single operating
segment, i.e., manufacturing and sale of
beverages. The Group operates in two principal
geographical areas, namely, India and other
countries or 'outside India'. The Group prepares
its segment information in conformity with
the accounting policies adopted for preparing
the CFS.

### o) Discontinued operations

A discontinued operation is a component of the
Group that either has been disposed of, or is
classified as held for sale, and:

· Represents a separate major line of business
or geographical area of operations;

· Is part of a single co-ordinated plan to
dispose of a separate major line of business
or geographical area of operations; or

· Is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a
view to resale.

Discontinued operations are excluded from
the results of continuing operations and are
presented as a single amount as profit or loss
after tax from discontinued operations in the
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss


### p) Impairment of non-financial assets

The Group assesses, at each reporting date,
whether there is an indication that an asset may
be impaired. If any indication exists, or when
annual impairment testing for an asset is required,
the Group estimates the asset's recoverable
amount. An asset's recoverable amount is
the higher of an asset's or cash-generating
unit's ("CGU") fair value less costs of disposal
and its value in use. Recoverable amount is
determined for an individual asset, unless the
asset does not generate cash inflows that are
largely independent of those from other assets
or groups of assets. When the carrying amount
of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable
amount, the asset is considered impaired and is
written down to its recoverable amount.

In assessing value in use, the estimated future
cash flows are discounted to their present value
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money
and the risks specific to the asset. In determining
fair value less costs of disposal, recent market
transactions are taken into account.

If no such transactions can be identified, an
appropriate valuation model is used. These
calculations are corroborated by valuation
multiples, quoted share prices for publicly

traded company's or other available fair value
indicators.

The Group bases its impairment calculation
on detailed budgets and forecast calculations,
which are prepared separately for each of the
Group's CGUs to which the individual assets
are allocated. These budgets and forecast
calculations generally cover a period of five
years. For longer periods, a long-term growth
rate is calculated and applied to project future
cash flows after the fifth year. To estimate cash
flow projections beyond periods covered by
the most recent budgets/forecasts, the Group
extrapolates cash flow projections in the budget
using a steady or declining growth rate for
subsequent years, unless an increasing rate
can be justified. In any case, this growth rate
does not exceed the long-term average growth
rate for the products, industries, or country or
countries in which the entity operates, or for the
market in which the asset is used.

Impairment losses of continuing operations,
including impairment on inventories, are
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of
Profit and Loss.

An assessment is made at each reporting date
to determine whether there is an indication that
previously recognised impairment losses no
longer exist or have decreased. If such indication
exists, the Group estimates the asset's or CGU's
recoverable amount. A previously recognised
impairment loss is reversed only if there has
been a change in the assumptions used to
determine the asset's recoverable amount since
the last impairment loss was recognised.

The reversal is limited so that the carrying
amount of the asset does not exceed its
recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined,
net of depreciation, had no impairment loss
been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Such reversal is recognised in the Consolidated
Statement of Profit and Loss unless the asset is
carried at a revalued amount, in which case, the
reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.

### q) Financial instruments

A financial instrument is any contract that gives
rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial
liability or equity instrument of another entity.

Financial assets


#### Initial recognition and measurement

All financial assets are recognised initially at
fair value, plus in the case of financial assets
not recorded at fair value through profit or
loss ("FVTPL"), transaction costs that are
attributable to the acquisition of the financial
asset. However, trade receivables that do not
contain a significant financing component are
measured at transaction price.

For purposes of subsequent measurement,
financial assets are classified as follows:


#### a) Debt instruments at amortised cost

A 'debt instrument' is measured at the
amortised cost where the asset is held
within a business model whose objective
is to hold assets for collecting contractual
cash flows; and contractual terms of the
asset give rise to cash flows on specified
dates that are solely payments of principal
and interest.

After initial measurement, such financial
assets are subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the EIR method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking
into account any discount or premium on
acquisition and fees or costs that are an
integral part of the EIR. The interest income
from these financial assets is included in
other income in the profit or loss. The losses
arising from impairment are recognised in
the profit or loss. This category generally
applies to trade and other receivables.


#### b) Debt instruments at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income

Assets that are held for collection of
contractual cashflows and for selling
the financial assets, where the cash flow
represent solely payments of principal and
interest, are measured at fair value through
other comprehensive income ("FVOCI").
The Group has not designated any debt
instrument in this category.


### c) Debt instruments at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss

Fair Value Through Profit or Loss ("FVTPL")
is a residual category for debt instruments.
Any debt instrument, which does not
meet the criteria for categorization as at
amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified
as at FVTPL.

In addition, the Group may elect to designate
a debt instrument which otherwise meets
amortized cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at
FVTPL. However, such election is allowed
only if doing so reduces or eliminates a
measurement or recognition inconsistency
(referred to as 'accounting mismatch').

Debt instruments included within the
FVTPL category are measured at fair
value with all changes recognised in the
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
The Group has not designated any debt
instrument in this category.


### d) Equity instruments

All equity investments in scope of Ind
AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity
instruments which are held for trading and
contingent consideration recognised by an
acquirer in a business combination to which
Ind AS 103 'Business Combinations' applies
are Ind AS classified as at FVTPL. Equity
instruments included within the FVTPL
category are measured at fair value with
all changes recognised in the Consolidated
Profit and Loss.

For all other equity instruments, the
Group may make an irrevocable election
to present in other comprehensive income
subsequent changes in the fair values.
The Group makes such election on an
instrument-by-instrument basis. The
classification is made on initial recognition
and is irrevocable.

If the Group decides to classify an equity
instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value
changes on the instrument, excluding
dividends, are recognised in the OCI. There
is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to

profit or loss, even on sale of investment.
However, the Group may transfer the
cumulative gain or loss within equity.


### De-recognition

A financial asset is derecognised when the
contractual rights to receive cash flows from
the asset have expired or the Group has
transferred its rights to receive the contractual
cash flows from the asset in a transaction in
which substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership of the asset are transferred.


#### Impairment of financial assets

The Group measures the Expected Credit
Loss ("ECL") associated with its assets based
on historical trends, industry practices and
the general business environment in which it
operates. The impairment methodology applied
depends on whether there has been a significant
increase in credit risk. ECL impairment loss
allowance (or reversal) recognised during the
period is recognised as income/ expense in
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss
under the head 'other expenses'.


### Financial liabilities


#### Initial recognition and measurement

Financial liabilities are classified, at initial
recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value
through profit or loss, loans and borrowings,
payables, or as derivatives designated as
hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as
appropriate.

All financial liabilities are recognised initially
at fair value and, in the case of loans and
borrowings and payables, net of directly
attributable transaction costs.

The Group's financial liabilities include trade and
other payables, loans and borrowings including
bank overdrafts and derivative financial
instruments.


#### Subsequent measurement

The measurement of financial liabilities depends
on their classification, as described below:


##### a) Financial liabilities at FVTPL

Financial liabilities at FVTPL include
financial liabilities held for trading and
financial liabilities designated upon initial
recognition as at fair value through profit
or loss. Financial liabilities are classified as
held for trading if they are incurred for the
purpose of repurchasing in the near term.
This category includes derivative financial
instruments entered into by the Group that
are not designated as hedging instruments in
hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109.

Financial liabilities designated upon initial
recognition at fair value through profit or
loss are designated as such at the initial date
of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind
AS 109 are satisfied. For liabilities designated
as FVTPL, fair value gains/ losses are
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of
Profit or Loss, except for those attributable
to changes in own credit risk, which are
recognised in OCI. These gains/ loss are not
subsequently transferred to the profit or loss.


##### b) Financial liabilities at amortised cost

After initial recognition, financial liabilities
designated at amortised costs are
subsequently measured at amortised cost
using the EIR method. Gains and losses
are recognised in profit or loss when the
liabilities are derecognised as well as
through the EIR amortisation process.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking
into account any discount or premium on
acquisition and fees or costs that are an
integral part of the EIR. The amortisation
is included as finance costs in the
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.


#### De-recognition

A financial liability is derecognised when the
obligation under the liability is discharged or
cancelled or expires. When an existing financial
liability is replaced by another from the same
lender on substantially different terms, or the
terms of an existing liability are substantially
modified, such an exchange or modification is
treated as the de-recognition of the original

## Summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information on the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024

liability and the recognition of a new liability. The
difference in the respective carrying amounts is
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of
Profit and Loss.


### Offsetting of financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset
and the net amount is reported in the balance
sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right
to offset the recognised amounts and there is an
intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the
assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.


### r) Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet
comprise cash at banks and on hand and
short-term deposits with an original maturity of
three months or less, which are subject to an
insignificant risk of changes in value.

For the purpose of the consolidated statement
of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist
of cash and short-term deposits, as defined
above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts
as they are considered an integral part of the
Group's cash management.


### s) Dividend distribution to equity holders of the parent

The Group recognises a liability to make cash or
non-cash distributions to equity holders of the
parent when the distribution is authorised and
the distribution is no longer at the discretion of
the Group. As per the corporate laws in India,
a distribution is authorised when it is approved
by the shareholders. A corresponding amount is
recognised directly in equity.


### t) Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has
a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a
result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow
of resources embodying economic benefits
will be required to settle the obligation and a
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of
the obligation. When the Group expects some or
all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example,
under an insurance contract, the reimbursement
is recognised as a separate asset, but only when
the reimbursement is virtually certain. The

expense relating to a provision is presented in
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss
net of any reimbursement.

If the effect of the time value of money is material,
provisions are discounted using a current
pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the
risks specific to the liability. When discounting
is used, the increase in the provision due to the
passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.


### u) Contingent liabilities

A contingent liability is a possible obligation that
arises from past events whose existence will be
confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence
of one or more uncertain future events beyond
the control of the Group or a present obligation
that is not recognised because it is not probable
that an outflow of resources will be required to
settle the obligation. A contingent liability also
arises in extremely rare cases where there is a
liability that cannot be recognised because it
cannot be measured reliably. The Group does
not recognize a contingent liability but discloses
its existence in the financial statements.
Contingent assets are only disclosed when it is
probable that the economic benefits will flow to
the entity.


### v) Earnings per share

Basic earnings/ (loss) per share are calculated
by dividing the net profit or loss for the year
attributable to equity shareholders by the
weighted average number of equity shares
outstanding during the year. The weighted
average number of equity shares outstanding
during the year is adjusted for events, other
than conversion of potential equity shares, that
have changed the number of equity shares
outstanding without a corresponding change in
resources.

In case of a bonus issue and sub-divison/split,
the number of ordinary shares outstanding is
increased by number of shares issued as bonus
shares and sub-divison/split respectively in
current year and comparative period presented
as if the event had occurred at the beginning of
the earliest year presented.

For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings/
(loss) per share, the net profit or loss for the
period attributable to equity shareholders
and the weighted average number of shares
outstanding during the period are adjusted for
the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares ..


### 3.1. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions

The preparation of the Group's financial
statements requires management to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of revenues,
expenses, assets and liabilities, and the
accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure
of contingent liabilities. Estimates and
assumptions are continuously evaluated and
are based on management's experience and
other factors, including expectations of future
events that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Uncertainty about
these assumptions and estimates could result
in outcomes that require a material adjustment
to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities
affected in future periods.

In particular, the Group has identified the
following areas where significant judgements,
estimates and assumptions are required. Further
information on each of these areas and how
they impact the various accounting policies are
described below and also in the relevant notes to
the consolidated financial statements. Changes
in estimates are accounted for prospectively.


### i) Judgements

In the process of applying the Group's
accounting policies, management has
made the following judgements, which
have the most significant effect on the
amounts recognised in the consolidated
financial statements:


#### a) Contingencies

Contingent liabilities may arise from
the ordinary course of business in
relation to claims against the Group,
including legal, contractor, land access
and other claims. By their nature,

contingencies will be resolved only
when one or more uncertain future
events occur or fail to occur. The
assessment of the existence, and
potential quantum, of contingencies
inherently involves the exercise of
significant judgments and the use of
estimates regarding the outcome of
future events.


#### b) Recognition of deferred tax assets

The extent to which deferred tax
assets can be recognised is based on
an assessment of the probability that
future taxable income will be available
against which the deductible temporary
differences and tax loss carry-forward
can be utilised. In addition, significant
judgement is required in assessing
the impact of any legal or economic
limits or uncertainties in various tax
jurisdictions.


#### ii) Estimates and assumptions

The key assumptions concerning the
future and other key sources of estimation
uncertainty at the reporting date that have
a significant risk of causing a material
adjustment to the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities within the next
financial year, are described below.
The Group bases its assumptions and
estimates on parameters available when
the consolidated financial statements
were prepared. Existing circumstances and
assumptions about future developments,
however, may change due to market
change or circumstances arising beyond
the control of the Group. Such changes
are reflected in the assumptions when
they occur.


##### a) Useful lives of tangible/intangible assets

The Group reviews its estimate of
the useful lives of tangible/intangible
assets at each reporting date, based
on the expected utility of the assets.

### b) Defined benefit obligation

The cost of the defined benefit
plan and other post-employment
benefits and the present value of
such obligation are determined using
actuarial valuations. An actuarial
valuation involves making various
assumptions that may differ from
actual developments in the future.
These include the determination
of the discount rate, future salary
increases, mortality rates and future
pension increases. In view of the
complexities involved in the valuation
and its long-term nature, a defined
benefit obligation is highly sensitive
to changes in these assumptions. All
assumptions are reviewed at each
reporting date.


### c) Inventories

The Group estimates the net realisable
values of inventories, taking into
account the most reliable evidence
available at each reporting date. The
future realisation of these inventories
may be affected by future technology
or other market-driven changes that
may reduce future selling prices.


### d) Business combinations

The Group uses valuation techniques
when determining the fair values of
certain assets and liabilities acquired
in a business combination.


### e) Impairment of non-financial assets and goodwill

In assessing impairment, Group
estimates the recoverable amount of
each asset or cash-generating units
based on expected future cash flows
and uses an interest rate to discount
them. Estimation uncertainty relates
to assumptions about future operating
results and the determination of a
suitable discount rate.


### f) Fair value measurement of financial instruments

When the fair values of financial assets
and financial liabilities recorded in the
Balance Sheet cannot be measured
based on quoted prices in active
markets, their fair value is measured
using valuation techniques including
the DCF model. The inputs to these
models are taken from observable
markets where possible, but where this
is not feasible, a degree of judgment
is required in establishing fair values.
Judgements include considerations of
inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk
and volatility. Changes in assumptions
about these factors could affect
the reported fair value of financial
instruments.

Footnotes to Note 5A and 5B:

i.
Goodwill and franchise rights/trade marks with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently
if the events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. The useful life of an intangible asset with
an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually to determine whether the useful life assessment continues to be supportable.


The Group has considered the relevant provisions of Ind AS 38 on 'Intangibles Assets' which provide factors to determine the
life of intangible assets and accordingly the carrying value of franchisee rights have been considered to have an indefinite
life. These franchisee rights meet the prescribed criteria of renewal at nominal cost, renewal with no specific conditions
attached, are sustainable and the same is supported by evidences of being renewed. Management is of the opinion that,
based on an analysis of all the relevant factors, there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the franchise rights are
expected to generate net cash inflows for the Group.

The assumptions used in this impairment assessment are most sensitive to following:

a) Weighted average cost of capital "WACC" of 12.07% to 16.45% (Previous year: 13.33%-18.90%) has been used for the
explicit period and for the terminal year.

b) For arriving at the terminal value, approximate growth rate of 2%-6% (Previous year: 2%-5%) is considered.

c) Number of years for which cash flows were considered are 5 years.

d) The approximate rate of growth in sales is estimated at 8%-13% (Previous year: 8%-10%) in the discrete period.
No impairment loss was identified on the above assessment.

ii. The amount of contractual commitments for the acquisitions of intangible assets are disclosed in Note 44.

iii. Refer Note 56 for information on other intangible assets pledged as security by the Group.

These assumptions were developed by management of the respective company/entity with the assistance of
independent actuaries wherever applicable. Discount factors are determined close to each year-end by reference
to market yields of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the respective currency in which the
benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligations.
Other assumptions are based on current actuarial benchmarks and respective management's historical experience.

The sensitivity analysis above has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the assumptions
occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.


<table>
<tr>
<td>Risk associated:</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Investment risk</td>
<td>The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to Government Bonds Yield. If plan liability is funded and return on plan assets is below this rate, it will create a plan deficit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Interest risk (discount rate risk)</td>
<td>A decrease in the bond interest rate (discount rate) will increase the plan liability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mortality risk</td>
<td>The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants. For this report we have used Indian Assured Lives Mortality (2012-2014) (31 December 2023: (2012-14) ultimate table). A change in mortality rate will have a bearing on the plan's liability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Salary risk</td>
<td>The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated with the assumption of salary increase rate of plan participants in future. Deviation in the rate of increase of salary in future for plan participants from the rate of increase in salary used to determine the present value of obligation will have a bearing on the plan's liability.</td>
</tr>
</table>


### Effect of the defined benefit plan on the Holding Company's future cash flows:


#### Funding arrangements and funding policy:

The Holding Company has purchased an insurance policy to provide for payment of gratuity to the employees.
Every year, the insurance Holding Company carries out a funding valuation based on the latest employee data
provided by the Holding Company. Any deficit in the assets arising as a result of such valuation is funded by the
Holding Company.

45\. Pursuant to transfer pricing legislations under the Income-tax Act, 1961, the Holding Company is required to
use specified methods for computing arm's length price in relation to specified international and domestic
transactions with its associated enterprises. Further, the Holding Company is required to maintain prescribed
information and documents in relation to such transactions. The appropriate method to be adopted will depend
on the nature of transactions/ class of transactions, class of associated persons, functions performed and other
factors, which have been prescribed. The Holding Company is in the process of updating its transfer pricing
documentation for the current financial year. Based on the preliminary assessment, the management is of the
view that the update would not have a material impact on the tax expense recorded in these consolidated
financial statements. Accordingly, these consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments for
the transfer pricing implications, if any.

## Summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information on the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024


### 47. Disclosure on lease transactions pursuant to Ind AS 116 - Leases

The Group lease asset class primarily consists of leases for land, buildings, plant and equipments and vehicles.
With the exception of short-term leases, leases of low-value and cancellable long-term leases underlying assets,
each lease is reflected on the balance sheet as a right of use asset and a lease liability.

Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the weighted
average borrowing rate on the date of adoption ranging between 5.44% - 13.56% (31 December 2023: 5.44% -
13.56%).

Each lease generally imposes a restriction that, unless there is a contractual right for the Group to sublet the asset
to another party, the right of use asset can only be used by the Group. Leases are either non-cancellable or may
only be cancelled by incurring a substantive termination fee. Some leases contain an option to extend the lease for
a further term. The Group is prohibited from selling or pledging the underlying leased assets other than leasehold
lands as security against the Group's other debts and liabilities.

i. Lease liabilities are presented in the balance sheet as under:

#### iv. Lease payments not recognised as a liability

of 12 months or less), non-cancellable long-term leases and for leases of low value assets. Payments made
under such leases are expensed on a straight-line basis. The expense relating to payments not included in the
measurement of the lease liability for short term leases is ₹ 1,616.21 (31 December 2023: ₹ 1,099.22 million).

### 53. Financial instruments risk


#### Financials risk management objectives and policies

The Group is exposed to various risks in relation to financial instruments. The main types of financial risks are
market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.

The respective management of the Holding Company and other companies/entities comprising the Group
monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the respective entity/Holding Company
on a continuous basis. The Group's risk management is coordinated at head office, in close cooperation with the
management of respective entity/Holding Company, and focuses on actively securing the short to medium-term
cash flows and simultaneously minimising the exposure to volatile financial markets. Long-term financial
investments are managed to generate lasting returns.

The Group does not engage in the trading of financial assets for speculative purposes. The most significant financial
risks to which the Group is exposed are described below.


#### 53.1 Market risk analysis

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because
of changes in market prices. The Group is exposed to market risk through its use of financial instruments and
specifically to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk, which result from its operating,
investing and financing activities. Contracts to hedge exposures in foreign currencies, interest rates etc. are
entered into wherever considered necessary by the management.


#### Foreign currency risk

Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of
changes in foreign exchange rates. The functional currency of the Holding Company is Indian Rupees ('INR' or '?').
Most of the transactions of the Holding Company and other entities/companies are carried out in the respective
local currency. Exposures to currency exchange rates mainly arise from the overseas operations and external
commercial borrowings etc., which are primarily denominated in US Dollar ("USD"), Euro ("EUR"), Pound Sterling
("GBP"), Zuid-Afrikaanse Rand ("ZAR"), ZWG (Zimbabwe Gold) and Zimbabwe Dollar ("ZWL").

To mitigate its exposure to foreign currency risk, the Group continuously monitors non-INR cash flows and hedging
contracts are entered into wherever considered necessary.

The carrying amounts of the Group's foreign currency denominated monetary items are restated at the end of each
reporting period. Foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities which expose the Group to currency
risk are as follows:

The foreign currency sensitivity of profit and equity in regards to the Group's financial assets and financial
liabilities considering 'all other things being equal' and ignoring the impact of taxation. It assumes a +/- 1%
change of the respective countries exchange rates (i.e. local currency to foreign currency) for the year ended at 31
December 2024 (31 December 2023: +/-1%). These are the sensitivity rates used when reporting foreign currency
exposures internally to the key management personnel and represents respective management's assessment of
the reasonably possible changes in the foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding
foreign currency denominated monetary items at end of each period reported upon. A positive number indicates
an increase in profit or equity and vice-versa.

Amounts below the rounding off norms adopted by the Group are presented as "0.00".

Exposures to foreign exchange rates vary during the year depending on the volume of the overseas transactions.
Nonetheless, the analysis above is considered to be representative of the Group's exposure to currency risk.


### Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because
of changes in market interest rates. The Group's policy is to minimise interest rate cash flow risk exposures on
long-term financing. The Group is exposed to changes in market interest rates as some of the bank and other
borrowings are at variable interest rates.

The following table illustrates the sensitivity of profit and equity to a reasonably possible change in interest
rates of +/- 1% (31 December 2023: +/- 1%). These changes are considered to be reasonably possible based on
management's assessment. The calculations are based on a change in the average market interest rate for each
period, and the financial instruments held at each reporting date that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. All
other variables are held constant.

#### Commodity price risk

The Group is affected by the price volatility of certain commodities. Its operating activities require the ongoing
purchase of sugar and pet chips and therefore require a continuous supply. In view of volatility of price of sugar
and pet chips, the Group also executes into various advance purchase contracts.

### 53.2 Credit risk analysis

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty fails to discharge an obligation to the Group. The Group is operating
through a network of distributors and other distribution partners based at different locations. The Group is exposed
to this risk for various financial instruments, for example loans granted, receivables from customers, deposits
placed etc. The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets
recognised at end of each reporting period, as summarised below:

The Group continuously monitors receivables and defaults of customers and other counterparties, and incorporates
this information into its credit risk controls. Appropriate security deposits are kept against the supplies to customers
and balances are reconciled at regular intervals. The Group's policy is to deal only with creditworthy counterparties.

In respect of trade and other receivables, the Group is not exposed to any significant credit risk exposure to any
single counterparty. Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers of various scales and in different
geographical areas. Based on historical information about customer default rates, management considers the
credit quality of trade receivables. In case the receivables are not recovered even after regular follow up, measures
are taken to stop further supplies to the concerned customer. The expected credit loss is based on the five years
historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward
looking estimates. Further, the Group has assessed the recoverability of grants receivable classified under other
current financial assets and accordingly provided for balance overdue for more than three years, amounting to
₹ 236.45 million (31 December 2023: Nil).

The credit risk for cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits including interest accrued thereon and Government
grant receivables is considered negligible, since the counterparties are reputable banks with high quality external
credit ratings and State Government bodies.

In respect of financial guarantees provided by the Group, the maximum exposure to which the Group is exposed
to is the maximum amount which it would have to pay if the guarantee is called upon. Based on the expectation at
the end of each reporting period, the Group considers that it is more likely than not that such an amount will not
be payable under the guarantees provided.

### 53.3 Liquidity risk analysis

Liquidity risk is that the Group might be unable to meet its obligations. The Group manages its liquidity needs by
monitoring scheduled debt servicing payments for long-term financial liabilities and considering the maturity profiles
of financial assets and other financial liabilities as well as forecast of operational cash inflows and outflows. Liquidity
needs are monitored in various time bands, on a day-to-day basis, a week-to-week basis and a month-to-month
basis. Long-term liquidity needs for a 180-day and a 360-day lookout period are identified monthly. Net cash
requirements are compared to available borrowing facilities in order to determine headroom or any shortfalls.

Funding for long-term liquidity needs is additionally secured by an adequate amount of committed credit facilities
and the Group's ability to avail further credit facilities subject to creation of requisite charge on its assets. The
Group assessed the concentration of risk with respect to refinancing its debt and concluded it to be low.

As at 31 December 2024, the Group's non-derivative financial liabilities have contractual undiscounted maturities

#### Valuation technique to determine fair value

Cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances, trade receivables, other current financial assets, trade payables,
current borrowings and other current financial liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the
short-term maturities of these instruments. The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is the amount at
which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced
or liquidation sale.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:

\- The fair values of the long term borrowings, loans and other deferred payments are determined by using
discounted cash flow method using the appropriate discount rate. The discount rate is determined using
other similar instruments incorporating the risk associated.

#### 55. Capital management

For the purpose of the Group's capital management, capital includes issued equity share capital, securities
premium and all other equity reserves attributable to the equity shareholders of the Group.

The Group's capital management objectives are:

· to ensure the Group's ability to continue as a going concern

· to provide an adequate return to shareholders

by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.

The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions and
the requirements of the financial covenants. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the
dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. The Group monitors capital
using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total capital plus net debt. The Group includes within net debt,
non-current and current borrowings and lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents, excluding discontinued
operations, if any.

The amounts managed as capital by the Group for the reporting periods are summarised as follows:

('the Company'), which comprise the Balance
Sheet as at 31 December 2024, the Statement of
Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive
Income), the Statement of Cash Flow and the
Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then
ended, and notes to the standalone financial
statements, including a summary of the material
accounting policies and other explanatory
information (hereinafter referred to as the
"standalone financial statements").

2\.
In our opinion and to the best of our information
and according to the explanations given to us, the
aforesaid standalone financial statements give the
information required by the Companies Act, 2013
('the Act') in the manner so required and give a
true and fair view in conformity with the Indian
Accounting Standards ('Ind AS') specified under
section 133 of the Act read with the Companies
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and
other accounting principles generally accepted in
India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at
31 December 2024, and its profit (including other
comprehensive income), its cash flows and the
changes in equity for the year ended on that date.


### Basis for Opinion

3\. We conducted our audit in accordance with the
Standards on Auditing specified under section
143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under
those standards are further described in the
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the
standalone financial statements section of our
report. We are independent of the Company in
accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ('the
ICAI') together with the ethical requirements
that are relevant to our audit of the standalone
financial statements under the provisions of the
Act and the rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance
with these requirements and the Code of Ethics.
We believe that the audit evidence obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our opinion.


### Key Audit Matters

4\. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our
professional judgment, were of most significance
in our audit of the standalone financial statements
of the current period. These matters were
addressed in the context of our audit of the
financial statements as a whole, and in forming
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a
separate opinion on these matters.

### Information other than the Financial Statements and Auditor's Report thereon

6\. The Company's Board of Directors are responsible
for the other information. The other information
comprises the information included in the
Management Discussion and Analysis, Report on
Corporate Governance and Director's Report, but
does not include the standalone financial statements
and our auditor's report thereon.

Our opinion on the standalone financial statements
does not cover the other information and we do not
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the standalone
financial statements, our responsibility is to read the
other information and, in doing so, consider whether
the other information is materially inconsistent
with the standalone financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise
appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the
work we have performed, we conclude that there is a
material misstatement of this other information, we
are required to report that fact. We have nothing to
report in this regard.

### Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Standalone Financial Statements

7\.
The accompanying standalone financial statements
have been approved by the Company's Board
of Directors. The Company's Board of Directors
are responsible for the matters stated in section
134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation
and presentation of these standalone financial
statements that give a true and fair view of the
financial position, financial performance including
other comprehensive income, changes in equity and
cash flows of the Company in accordance with the
Ind AS specified under section 133 of the Act and
other accounting principles generally accepted in
India. This responsibility also includes maintenance
of adequate accounting records in accordance
with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of
the assets of the Company and for preventing and
detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection
and application of appropriate accounting policies;
making judgments and estimates that are reasonable
and prudent; and design, implementation and
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls,
that were operating effectively for ensuring the
accuracy and completeness of the accounting
records, relevant to the preparation and presentation
of the financial statements that give a true and
fair view and are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error.

8\.
In preparing the financial statements, the Board of
Directors is responsible for assessing the Company's
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as
applicable, matters related to going concern, and
using the going concern basis of accounting unless
the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the
Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic
alternative but to do so.

9\.
The Board of Directors is also responsible for
overseeing the Company's financial reporting
process.


### Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements

10\. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the standalone financial statements as
a whole are free from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that

an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on
Auditing will always detect a material misstatement
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if, individually or in
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to
influence the economic decisions of users taken on
the basis of these standalone financial statements.

11\.
As part of an audit in accordance with the Standards
on Auditing, specified under section 143(10) of the
Act, we exercise professional judgment and maintain
professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

. Identify and assess the risks of material
misstatement of the standalone financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error,
design and perform audit procedures responsive
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher
than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal
control;

· Obtain an understanding of internal control
relevant to the audit in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances. Under section 143(3) (i) of the
Act, we are also responsible for expressing our
opinion on whether the Company has adequate
internal financial controls with reference
to financial statements and the operating
effectiveness of such controls;

· Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting
policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures
made by the management;

· Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board
of Directors' use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast
significant doubt on the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that
a material uncertainty exists, we are required
to draw attention in our auditor's report to the
related disclosures in the standalone financial
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate,
to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are

<!-- PageFooter="Annual Report 2024 335" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->


<figure>

<!-- PageHeader="VB WARUN BEVERAGES" -->

</figure>


based on the audit evidence obtained up to the
date of our auditor's report. However, future
events or conditions may cause the Company
to cease to continue as a going concern.

· Evaluate the overall presentation, structure
and content of the financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the
financial statements represent the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that
achieves fair presentation.

12\. We communicate with those charged with
governance regarding, among other matters, the
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies
in internal control that we identify during our audit.

13\.
We also provide those charged with governance with
a statement that we have complied with relevant
ethical requirements regarding independence, and
to communicate with them all relationships and
other matters that may reasonably be thought to
bear on our independence, and where applicable,
related safeguards.

14\. From the matters communicated with those charged
with governance, we determine those matters that
were of most significance in the audit of the financial
statements of the current period and are therefore
the key audit matters. We describe these matters
in our auditor's report unless law or regulation
precludes public disclosure about the matter or
when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine
that a matter should not be communicated in our
report because the adverse consequences of doing
so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the
public interest benefits of such communication.


### Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

15\. As required by section 197(16) of the Act based on
our audit, we report that the Company has paid

with the understanding, whether

## Annexure I referred to in Paragraph 17 of the Independent Auditor's Report of even date to the members of Varun Beverages Limited on the standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024

In terms of the information and explanations sought by us
and given by the Company and the books of account and
records examined by us in the normal course of audit, and
to the best of our knowledge and belief, we report that:

(i) (a) (A) The Company has maintained proper
records showing full particulars, including
quantitative details and situation of
property, plant and equipment, capital
work-in-progress and relevant details of
right-of-use assets.

(B) The Company has maintained proper
records showing full particulars of intangible
assets including intangible assets under
development.

(b) The property, plant and equipment (other than
refrigerators (Visi coolers) and containers lying
with third parties) and right-of-use assets have
been physically verified by the management
during the year and no material discrepancies
were noticed on such verification. The Company
has a regular programme of physical verification

of refrigerators (Visi coolers) under which
such assets are verified in a phased manner
over a period of three years and no material
discrepancies were noticed on such verification.
According to the information and explanations
given to us, the existence of containers lying
with third parties is considered on the basis
of the confirmations obtained from such
third parties. In our opinion, the frequency of
physical verification programme adopted by the
Company, is reasonable having regard to the
size of the Company and the nature of its assets.

(c)
The title deeds of all the immovable properties
held by the Company (other than properties
where the Company is the lessee and the lease
agreements are duly executed in favour of the
lessee), disclosed in Note 4A to the standalone
financial statements, are held in the name of the
Company. For properties where the Company
is a lessee and the lease agreements are duly
executed in favour of the lessee except in
following case:


<table>
<tr>
<th>Description of property</th>
<th>Gross carrying value (₹ million)</th>
<th>Net carrying value (₹ million)</th>
<th>Whether title deed holder is a Promoter, director or relative of promoter/ director or employee</th>
<th>Date since the property is held</th>
<th>Reasons</th>

We have directly obtained the confirmation from the
trust for title deeds of immovable properties, which
are in the nature of land, having gross carrying value
of 13,384.39 million as at 31 December 2024. The
title deeds of such immovable properties have been
mortgaged as security for loans or borrowings taken
by the Company.

(d) The Company has not revalued its property,
plant and equipment (including right-of-use
assets) or intangible assets during the year.

(e) No proceedings have been initiated or are
pending against the Company for holding
any benami property under the Prohibition of

(ii) (a) The management has conducted physical
verification of inventory at reasonable intervals
during the year, except for goods-in-transit. In

aggregate for each class of inventory were noticed
as compared to book records.

(b) As disclosed in Note 19A to the standalone
financial statements, the Company has been
sanctioned a working capital limit in excess of Rs.
50 million by banks or financial institutions based
on the security of current assets. The quarterly

statements, in respect of the working capital limits
have been filed by the Company with such banks
or financial institutions and such statements are
in agreement with the books of account of the
Company for the respective periods, which were
subject to audit/review.

(iii) (a)
The Company has not provided security or granted
any loans or advances in the nature of loans,
secured or unsecured to companies, firms, Limited
Liability Partnerships (LLPs) or any other parties
during the year. The Company has provided loans
or guarantee, to Subsidiaries during the year as
per details given below:


<table>
<tr>
<th>Particulars</th>
<th>Guarantees (₹ million)</th>
<th>Loans (₹ million)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aggregate amount provided/granted during the year</td>
<td>12,075.07</td>
<td>7,994.24</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Balance outstanding as at balance sheet date</td>
<td>15,776.40</td>
<td>15,403.40</td>
</tr>
</table>


Further, the Company has made investment in 6
entities amounting to ₹ 6,438.39 million (year-end
balance ₹ 20,922.18 million).

(b) In our opinion, and according to the information
and explanations given to us, the investments
made, guarantees provided and terms and
conditions of the grant of all loans and guarantees
provided are, prima facie, not prejudicial to the
interest of the Company. Further the Company
has not provided any advances in the nature of
loans or given any security.

(c) In respect of loans granted by the Company,
the schedule of repayment of principal and
payment of interest has been stipulated and the
repayments/receipts of principal and interest
are regular.

granted by the Company.

(e) The Company has not granted any loan or
advance in the nature of loan which has fallen
due during the year. Further, no fresh loans

loans/advances in nature of loan that existed as
at the beginning of the year.

(f) The Company has not granted any loans or
advances in the nature of loans, which are
repayable on demand or without specifying any
terms or period of repayment.

(iv) In our opinion, and according to the information
and explanations given to us, the Company has
complied with the provisions of section 186 of the
Act in respect of loans and investments made and
guarantees provided by it, as applicable. Further,
the Company has not entered into any transaction
covered under section 185 and section 186 of the Act
in respect of security provided by it.

In our opinion, and according to the information
and explanations given to us, the Company has not
accepted any deposits or there are no amounts
which have been deemed to be deposits within the
meaning of sections 73 to 76 of the Act and the
Companies (Acceptance of Deposits) Rules, 2014 (as
amended). Accordingly, reporting under clause 3(v)
of the Order is not applicable to the Company.

(vi) The Central Government has specified maintenance
of cost records under sub-section (1) of section
148 of the Act in respect of the products of the
Company. We have broadly reviewed the books of
account maintained by the Company pursuant to
the rules made by the Central Government for the
maintenance of cost records and are of the opinion
that, prima facie, the prescribed accounts and
records have been made and maintained. However,
we have not made a detailed examination of the cost
records with a view to determine whether they are
accurate or complete.

## Annexure II


### Independent Auditor's Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the standalone financial statements under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act')

1\.
In conjunction with our audit of the standalone
financial statements of Varun Beverages Limited ('the
Company') as at and for the year ended 31 December
2024, we have audited the internal financial controls
with reference to financial statements of the
Company as at that date.


#### Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for Internal Financial Controls

2\. The Company's Board of Directors is responsible
for establishing and maintaining internal financial
controls based on the internal financial controls
with reference to standalone financial statements
criteria established by the Company considering
the essential components of internal control
stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal
Financial Controls over Financial Reporting ('the
Guidance Note') issued by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India ('ICAI'). These responsibilities
include the design, implementation and maintenance
of adequate internal financial controls that were
operating effectively for ensuring the orderly
and efficient conduct of the Company's business,
including adherence to the Company's policies,
the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and
completeness of the accounting records, and the
timely preparation of reliable financial information,
as required under the Act.


#### Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements

3\. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company's internal financial controls with reference
to financial statements based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards
on Auditing issued by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India ('ICAI') prescribed under
Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable
to an audit of internal financial controls with
reference to financial statements, and the Guidance
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over
Financial Reporting ('the Guidance Note') issued by
the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note
require that we comply with ethical requirements
and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether adequate internal financial

controls with reference to financial statements were
established and maintained and if such controls
operated effectively in all material respects.

4\.
Our audit involves performing procedures to
obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the
internal financial controls with reference to financial
statements and their operating effectiveness. Our
audit of internal financial controls with reference
to financial statements includes obtaining an
understanding of such internal financial controls,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,
and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on
the auditor's judgement, including the assessment
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error.

5\.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial
controls with reference to financial statements.


#### Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements

6\. A company's internal financial controls with reference
to financial statements is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company's internal financial controls with reference
to financial statements include those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorisations of
management and directors of the company; and (3)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use,
or disposition of the company's assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

<!-- PageHeader="CORPORATE OVERVIEW" -->
<!-- PageHeader="STATUTORY REPORTS" -->
<!-- PageHeader="FINANCIAL STATEMENTS" -->


## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements

7\. Because of the inherent limitations of internal
financial controls with reference to financial
statements, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and
not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation
of the internal financial controls with reference to
financial statements to future periods are subject
to the risk that the internal financial controls with
reference to financial statements may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.


## Opinion

8\. In our opinion, the Company has, in all material
respects, adequate internal financial controls with
reference to financial statements and such controls
were operating effectively as at 31 December
2024, based on the internal financial controls
with reference to standalone financial statements
criteria established by the Company considering
the essential components of internal control
stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.

## Summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information on the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024


### 3 Material accounting policies


#### 3.1 Fair value measurements

The Company measures financial instruments at
fair value which is the price that would be received
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between independent market
participants at the measurement date. The fair value
measurement is based on the presumption that the
transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability
takes place either:

· In the principal market for the asset or liability, or

. In the absence of a principal market, in the most
advantageous market for the asset or liability.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is
measured or disclosed in the financial statements are
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described
as follows, based on the lowest level input that is
significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities;

Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest
level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement is directly or indirectly observable; and

Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest
level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement is unobservable.

The Company uses valuation techniques that are
appropriate in the circumstances and for which
sufficient data are available to measure fair value,
maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and
minimising the use of unobservable inputs. For assets
and liabilities that are recognised in the balance
sheet at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company
determines whether transfers have occurred between
levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation
(based on the lowest level input that is significant to
the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of
each reporting period.

For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the
Company has determined classes of assets and
liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics
and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the
fair value hierarchy as explained above.


#### 3.2 Revenue recognition

Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control
of promised goods or services to customers at an
amount that reflects the consideration to which the
Company is expected to be entitled to in exchange
for those goods or services. Revenue towards
satisfaction of a performance obligation is measured
at the amount of transaction price (net of variable
considerations) allocated to that performance
obligation as per contractually agreed terms with the
customers. The transaction price of goods sold and
services rendered is net of variable considerations on
account of various discounts and schemes offered
by the Company as part of the contract. Revenue
is recorded provided the recovery of consideration
is probable and determinable. Revenue from sale
of goods and services transferred to distributors/
intermediaries are recognised at a point in time.


##### a) Sale of goods:

Revenue from the sale of manufactured and
traded goods products is recognised upon
transfer of control of products to the customers
which coincides with their delivery to customer
and is measured at fair value of consideration
received/receivable, net of discounts, amount
collected on behalf of third parties and
applicable taxes.


##### b) Interest:

Interest income is recognised on time
proportion basis taking into account the amount
outstanding and rate applicable. For all debt
instruments measured at amortised cost, interest
income is recorded using the effective interest
rate ("EIR"). EIR is the rate that exactly discounts
the estimated future cash payments or receipts
over the expected life of the financial instrument
or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the
gross carrying amount of the financial assets.
Interest income is included in other income in
the Statement of Profit and Loss.


##### c) Dividends:

Dividend is recognised when the Company's
right to receive the payment is established,
which is generally when shareholders approve
the dividend.

## Summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information on the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024

d) Commission:

Commission income is recognised rateably
over the contract period as per the agreed
contractual terms.

e)
Services rendered:

Revenue from service related activities including
management and technical know-how service,
job work are recognised as and when services
are rendered and on the basis of contractual
terms with the parties.


### 3.3 Inventories

Inventories are valued as follows:

a) Raw materials, components, stores and spares:
At lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost
of inventory comprises all costs of purchases,
duties, taxes (other than those subsequently
recoverable from tax authorities) and all other
costs incurred in bringing the inventory to
their present location and condition and is
determined on a moving weighted average cost
basis.

However, materials and other items held for use
in the production of inventories are not written
down below cost if the finished products in
which they will be incorporated are expected to
be sold at or above cost.

b) Work-in-progress: At lower of cost and net
realisable value. Cost for this purpose includes
material, labour and appropriate allocation
of overheads including depreciation. Cost is
determined on a weighted average basis.

c)
:) Intermediate goods/ Finished goods:

i. Self manufactured - At lower of cost and
net realisable value. Cost for this purpose
includes material, labour and appropriate
allocation of overheads. Cost is determined
on a weighted average basis.

ii. Traded - At lower of cost and net realisable
value. Cost of inventory comprises all costs
of purchases, duties, taxes (other than
those subsequently recoverable from tax
authorities) and all other costs incurred
in bringing the inventory to their present

location and condition and is determined
on a weighted average cost basis.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price
in the ordinary course of business, less estimated
costs of completion and estimated costs necessary
to make the sale. Provision for obsolescence is
determined based on management's assessment
and is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss


### 3.4 Property, plant and equipment

Measurement at recognition:

Property, plant and equipment and capital work-
in progress are stated at cost, net of accumulated
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.

Cost comprises the purchase price, borrowing costs
if capitalisation criteria are met and any directly
attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working
condition for the intended use. Any trade discounts and
rebates are deducted in arriving at the purchase price.
The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment
shall be recognised as an asset if, and only if:

a) it is probable that future economic benefits
associated with the item will flow to the entity; and

b) the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

Subsequent expenditure related to an item of property,
plant and equipment is added to its book value only if
it increased the future benefits from the existing asset
beyond its previously assessed standard of performance.
All other expenses on existing assets, including day-to-
day repair and maintenance expenditure and cost of
replacing parts, are charged to the Statement of Profit
and Loss for the period during which such expenses are
incurred. Expenditure directly relating to construction
activity is capitalised. Indirect expenditure incurred
during construction period is capitalised as a part of
indirect construction cost to the extent the expenditure
is related to construction or is incidental thereto. Other
indirect costs incurred during the construction periods
which are not related to construction activity nor are
incidental thereto are charged to the Statement of Profit
and Loss.

Value for individual assets acquired for a consolidated
price, the cost is apportioned to the various assets
on their relative fair values basis as determined by
competent valuers.

### Depreciation:

The management has estimated, supported by
technical assessment, the useful lives of property,
plant and equipment. The management believes
that these estimated useful lives are realistic and
reflect fair approximation of the period over which
the assets are likely to be used. Depreciation is
calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the assets as follows:


<table>
<tr>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Useful lives (upto)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Leasehold land</td>
<td>Over lease period</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Buildings-factory</td>
<td>30 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Buildings-others</td>
<td>60 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Plant and equipment</td>
<td>20 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Furniture and fixtures</td>

<tr>
<td>Containers</td>
<td>6 years</td>

<tr>
<td>Post-mix vending machines and refrigerators (Visi - Cooler)</td>
<td>8 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Power generating assets*</td>
<td>22 years</td>
</tr>
</table>

*Included in plant and equipment in financial statements.


Freehold land is not depreciated.

Depreciation on property, plant and equipment
is provided over the useful lives of assets as
specified in Schedule II to the Act except where
the management, based on independent technical
assessment, depreciates certain assets are over
estimated useful lives which are different from the
useful lives prescribed in the Schedule II to the Act.
The Company has used the remaining useful lives
to compute depreciation on its property, plant and
equipment, acquired under the business transfer
agreement based on external technical evaluation.

Depreciation on property, plant and equipment
which are added/disposed off during the year is
provided on pro-rata basis with reference to the
month of addition/deletion.

The Company has technically evaluated all the
property, plant and equipment for determining the
separate identifiable assets having different useful
lives under the component approach. On technical
evaluation of all separate identifiable components,

the management is of the opinion that they do
not have any different useful life from that of the
principal asset.

In case of revaluation of leasehold land, the resulting
amortisation of the total revalued amount is
expensed off to the Statement of Profit and Loss.


### Derecognition:

An item of property, plant and equipment and any
significant part initially recognised is de-recognised
upon disposal or when no future economic benefits
are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss
arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as
the difference between the net disposal proceeds or
amount of security deposit adjusted and the carrying
amount of the asset) is included in the Statement of
Profit and Loss when the asset is de-recognised.

Breakages of containers are adjusted on 'first
bought first broken' basis, since it is not feasible
to specifically identify the broken containers in the
fixed assets records.


### 3.5 Intangible assets

Intangible assets are initially recognised at:

a) In case the assets are acquired separately, then
at cost,

b) In case the assets are acquired in a business
combination or under any asset purchase
agreement, at fair value.

Following initial recognition, intangible assets are
carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation
and accumulated impairment loss. Intangible assets
with finite useful life are assessed for impairment
whenever there is an indication that the intangible
assets may be impaired. Amortisation of intangible
assets such as softwares and distribution network
is computed on a straight-line basis, at the rates
representing estimated useful life of 4 years and
8 years respectively.

The franchise rights and trademarks acquired as
part of business combinations normally have a
remaining legal life of not exceeding twenty years
but is renewable every twenty years and is well
established. The Company intends to renew these
rights continuously and evidence supports its
ability to do so. An analysis of product life cycle

## Summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information on the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024

studies, market and competitive trends provides
evidence that the product will generate net cash
inflows for the Company for an indefinite period.
Therefore, these rights have been carried at cost
without amortisation, but is tested for impairment
annually, at the cash-generating unit level. The
assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to
determine whether the indefinite life continues to
be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from
indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.


### 3.6 Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs include interest, amortisation
of ancillary costs incurred in connection with
the arrangement of borrowings and exchange
differences arising from foreign currency borrowings
to the extent they are regarded as an adjustment
to the interest cost. Borrowing costs, if any, directly
attributable to the acquisition, construction or
production of an asset that necessarily takes a
substantial period of time to get ready for its
intended use or sale are capitalized, if any. All other
borrowing costs are expensed to the Statement of
Profit and Loss in the period in which they occur.


### 3.7 Leases


#### The Company as a lessee

The Company enters into an arrangement for lease
of buildings and equipments. Such arrangements are
generally for a fixed period but may have extension
or termination options. In accordance with Ind AS 116
\- Leases, at inception of the contract, the Company
assesses whether a contract is, or contains a lease. A
lease is defined as 'a contract, or part of a contract,
that conveys the right to control the use an asset (the
underlying asset) for a period of time in exchange for
consideration'.

To assess whether a contract conveys the right to
control the use of an identified asset, the Company
assesses whether:

a)
The contract involves the use of an identified
asset - this may be specified explicitly or
implicitly, and should be physically distinct or
represent substantially all of the capacity of a
physically distinct asset. If the supplier has a
substantive substitution right, then the asset is
not identified;

b)
The Company has the right to obtain substantially
all of the economic benefits from use of the asset
throughout the period of use; and

c) The Company assesses whether it has the right
to direct 'how and for what purpose' the asset is
used throughout the period of use. At inception or
on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease
component, the Company allocates the consideration
in the contract to each lease component on the basis
of their relative stand-alone prices. However, for the
leases of land and buildings in which it is a lessee,
the Company has elected not to separate non-lease
components and account for the lease and non-lease
components as a single lease component.


#### Measurement and recognition of leases as a lessee

The Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a
lease liability at the lease commencement date. The
right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which
comprises the initial amount of the lease liability
adjusted for any lease payments made at or before
the commencement date, plus any initial direct
costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle
and remove the underlying asset or to restore the
underlying asset or the site on which it is located,
less any lease incentives received.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at
cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated
impairment losses (unless such right of use assets
fulfills the requirements of Ind AS 40 - Investment
Property and is accounted for as there under), if any
and adjusted for any re-measurement of the lease
liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using
the straight-line method from the commencement
date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of
right-of-use asset. Right-of-use asset are tested for
impairment whenever there is any indication that
their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the Statement
of Profit and Loss.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present
value of the lease payments that are not paid at the
commencement date, discounted using the interest
rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be
readily determined, the Company's incremental
borrowing rate. Generally, the Company uses its
incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the
lease liability comprise the following:

a)
Fixed payments, including in-substance fixed
payments;

<!-- PageHeader="STATUTORY REPORTS" -->
<!-- PageHeader="CORPORATE OVERVIEW" -->


## Summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information on the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024

b) Variable lease payments that depend on an
index or a rate, initially measured using the
index or rate as at the commencement date;

c) Amounts expected to be payable under a
residual value guarantee; and

d) The exercise price under a purchase option that
the Company is reasonably certain to exercise,
lease payments in an optional renewal period if
the Company is reasonably certain to exercise
an extension option, and penalties for early
termination of a lease unless the Company is
reasonably certain not to terminate early.

The lease liability is measured at amortized cost
using the effective interest rate method. It is
remeasured when there is a change in future lease
payments arising from a change in an index or rate,
if there is a change in the Company's estimate of
the amount expected to be payable under a residual
value guarantee, or if the Company changes its
assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase,
extension or termination option. When the lease
liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding
adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the
right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if
the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has
been reduced to zero, as the case may be.

The Company presents right-of-use assets that
do not meet the definition of investment property
and lease liabilities as a separate line item in the
standalone financial statements of the Company.

The Company has elected not to apply the
requirements of Ind AS 116 - Leases to short-term
leases of all assets that have a lease term of 12
months or less and leases for which the underlying
asset is of low value. The lease payments associated
with these leases are recognized as an expense on a
straight-line basis over the lease term.


### The Company as a lessor

When the Company acts as a lessor, it determines at
lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease
or an operating lease. To classify each lease, the
Company makes an overall assessment of whether
the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and
rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying
asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance
lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part

of this assessment, the Company considers certain
indicators such as whether the lease is for the major
part of the economic life of the asset.

When the Company is an intermediate lessor, it
accounts for its interests in the head lease and
the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease
classification of a sub-lease with reference to the
right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not
with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease
is a short-term lease to which the Company applies
the exemption described above, then it classifies the
sub-lease as an operating lease.

The Company recognizes lease payments received
under operating leases as income on a straight-line
basis over the lease term as part of 'other income'.

The accounting policies applicable to the Company
as a lessor in the comparative period were not
different from Ind AS 116 - Leases. However, when the
Company was an intermediate lessor the sub-leases
were classified with reference to the underlying asset.

The Company recognizes lease payments received
under operating leases as income on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. In case of a finance lease,
finance income is recognised over the lease term
based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic
rate of return on the lessor's net investment in
the lease. When the Company is an intermediate
lessor it accounts for its interests in the head lease
and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease
classification of a sub-lease with reference to the
right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not
with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease
is a short term lease to which the Company applies
the exemption described above, then it classifies the
sub-lease as an operating lease.


#### 3.8 Employee benefits


##### Contribution to provident and other funds

Retirement benefit in the form of provident fund is
a defined contribution scheme. The Company has
no obligation, other than the contribution payable
to the provident fund. The Company recognises
contribution payable to the provident fund scheme
as an expense, when an employee renders the
related service. If the contribution payable to the
scheme for service received before the balance

sheet date exceeds the contribution already paid,
the deficit payable to the scheme is recognised as
a liability after deducting the contribution already
paid. If the contribution already paid exceeds the
contribution due for services received before the
balance sheet date, then excess is recognised as
an asset to the extent that the pre-payment will
lead to, for example, a reduction in future payment
or a cash refund.


### Gratuity

Gratuity is a defined benefit scheme. The cost of
providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is
determined using the projected unit credit method.
The Company recognises termination benefit as
a liability and an expense when the Company has
a present obligation as a result of past event, it is
probable that an outflow of resources embodying
economic benefits will be required to settle the
obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the
amount of the obligation. If the termination benefits
fall due more than twelve months after the balance
sheet date, they are measured at present value of
future cash flows using the discount rate determined
by reference to market yields at the balance sheet
date on government bonds.

Re-measurements, comprising actuarial gains and
losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding
amounts included in net interest on the net defined
benefit liability and the return on plan assets (excluding
amounts included in net interest on the net defined
benefit liability), are recognised immediately in the
balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit
to retained earnings through Other Comprehensive
Income ("OCI") in the period in which they occur.
Re-measurements are not reclassified to profit or
loss in subsequent periods.

Past service costs are recognised in Statement of
Profit and Loss on the earlier of:

· The date of the plan amendment or curtailment,
and

· The date that the Company recognises related
restructuring cost

Net interest is calculated by applying the
discount rate to the net defined benefit liability
or asset.

The Company recognises the following changes
in the net defined benefit obligation as an
expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss:

· Service costs comprising current service
costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on
curtailments and non-routine settlements; and

. Net interest expense or income


### Compensated absences

The Company treats accumulated leave expected
to be carried forward beyond twelve months, as
long-term employee benefit which are computed
based on the actuarial valuation using the projected
unit credit method at the period end. Actuarial gains/
losses are immediately taken to the Statement of
Profit and Loss and are not deferred. The Company
presents the leave as a current liability in the balance
sheet to the extent it does not have an unconditional
right to defer its settlement for twelve months
after the reporting date. Where Company has the
unconditional legal and contractual right to defer the
settlement for a period beyond twelve months, the
balance is presented as a non-current liability.

Accumulated leave, which is expected to be utilized
within the next twelve months, is treated as short
term employee benefit. The Company measures the
expected cost of such absences as the additional
amount that it expects to pay as a result of the
unused entitlement that has accumulated at the
reporting date.

All other employee benefits payable/available within
twelve months of rendering the service are classified
as short-term employee benefits. Benefits such as
salaries, wages, bonus, etc. are recognised in the
Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which
the employee renders the related service.


### 3.9 Share-based payments

Employees (including senior executives) of the Group
receive remuneration in the form of share-based
payments, whereby employees render services
as consideration for equity instruments which are
classified as equity-settled transactions.

The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined
by the fair value at the date of grant using an
appropriate valuation model. That cost is recognised

as an employee benefit expense with a corresponding
increase in 'Share option outstanding account' in
other equity, over the period in which the service
conditions are fulfilled in relation to options granted
to employees of the Company. Further, In relation to
options granted to employees of subsidiaries, the
amount is disclosed under non-current investments
with a corresponding increase in 'Share option
outstanding account' and disclosed as equity
contribution in subsidiaries.

The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled
transactions at each reporting date until the vesting
date reflects the extent to which the vesting period
has expired and the Company's best estimate of the
number of equity instruments that will ultimately
vest.

Service and non-market performance conditions
are not taken into account when determining the
grant date fair value of awards, but the likelihood
of the conditions being met is assessed as part of
the Company's best estimate of the number of
equity instruments that will ultimately vest. Market
performance conditions are reflected within the
grant date fair value. Any other conditions attached
to an award, but without an associated service
requirement, are considered to be non-vesting
conditions.

Non-vesting conditions are reflected in the fair value
of an award and lead to an immediate expensing
of an award unless there are also service and/or
performance conditions.

No expense is recognised for awards that do not
ultimately vest because non-market performance
and/or service conditions have not been met. Where
awards include a market or non-vesting condition,
the transactions are treated as vested irrespective
of whether the market or non-vesting condition is
satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or
service conditions are satisfied.

When the terms of an equity-settled award are
modified, the minimum expense recognised is the
expense had the terms had not been modified, if the
original terms of the award are met. An additional
expense is recognised for any modification that
increases the total fair value of the share-based
payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the
employee as measured at the date of modification.

Where an award is cancelled by the Company or by
the counterparty, any remaining element of the fair
value of the award is expensed immediately through
the Statement of Profit and Loss.

The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected
as additional share dilution in the computation of
diluted earnings per share.


### 3.10 Foreign currency transactions and translations

Transactions in foreign currencies are initially
recorded in the functional currency, by applying
to the foreign currency amount the exchange rate
between the functional currency and the foreign
currency at the date of the transaction.

Foreign currency monetary items are reported using
the closing rate. Non-monetary items which are
carried in terms of historical cost denominated in a
foreign currency are reported using the exchange
rate at the date of the transaction.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of
monetary items or on restatement of the Company's
monetary items at rates different from those at
which they were initially recorded during the year,
or reported in previous financial statements, are
recognised as income or as expenses in the year in
which they arise.

Exchange differences pertaining to long-term foreign
currency monetary items obtained or given on or
before 31 December 2016: Exchange differences
arising on conversion of long term foreign currency
monetary items used for acquisition of depreciable
fixed assets are added to the cost of fixed assets
and is depreciated over the remaining life of the
respective fixed asset and in other cases, is recorded
under the head 'Foreign Currency Monetary Item
Translation Difference Account' and is amortised
over the period of maturity of underlying long term
foreign currency monetary items, in accordance with
the option available under Ind AS 101.

Exchange differences pertaining to long-term
foreign currency monetary items obtained or given
on or after 01 January 2017: Exchange differences
arising on restatement of long term foreign currency
monetary items obtained or given is recorded in the
Statement of Profit and Loss.

### 3.11 Business combination and goodwill

Business combinations are accounted for using
the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition
is measured as the aggregate of the consideration
transferred measured at acquisition date fair value
and the amount of any non-controlling interests in
the acquiree. At the acquisition date, the identifiable
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are
recognised at their acquisition date fair values.
For this purpose, the liabilities assumed include
contingent liabilities representing present obligation
and they are measured at their acquisition fair values
irrespective of the fact that outflow of resources
embodying economic benefits is not probable.
However, deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the
assets or liabilities related to employee benefit
arrangements are recognised and measured in
accordance with Ind AS 12 'Income Taxes' and Ind AS
19 'Employee Benefits' respectively.

When the Company acquires a business, it assesses
the financial assets and liabilities assumed for
appropriate classification and designation in
accordance with the contractual terms, economic
circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the
acquisition date.

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the
Company is recognised at fair value at the acquisition
date. Contingent consideration classified as an asset
or liability that is a financial instrument and within
the scope of Ind AS 109 'Financial Instruments' ('Ind
AS 109'), is measured at fair value with changes in
fair value recognised in the Statement of Profit and
Loss. If the contingent consideration is not within the
scope of Ind AS 109, it is measured in accordance
with the appropriate Ind AS.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess
of the aggregate of the consideration transferred
over the net identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the net assets
acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration
transferred, the Company re-assesses whether it has
correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all
of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures
used to measure the amounts to be recognised at
the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results
in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired

over the aggregate consideration transferred, then
the gain is recognised in OCI and accumulated in
equity as capital reserve. However, if there is no clear
evidence of bargain purchase, the entity recognises
the gain directly in equity as capital reserve, without
routing the same through OCI.

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost
less any accumulated impairment losses. For the
purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in
a business combination is, from the acquisition date,
allocated to each of the Company's cash-generating
units that are expected to benefit from the
combination, irrespective of whether other assets or
liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.

A cash generating unit to which goodwill has been
allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more
frequently when there is an indication that the unit
may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the
cash generating unit is less than its carrying amount,
the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the
unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro
rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in
the unit.

Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised in
the Statement of Profit and Loss. An impairment loss
recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent
periods.

Where goodwill has been allocated to a
cash-generating unit and part of the operation within
that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with
the disposed operation is included in the carrying
amount of the operation when determining the
gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these
circumstances is measured based on the relative
values of the disposed operation and the portion of
the cash-generating unit retained.

If the initial accounting for a business combination
is incomplete by the end of the reporting
period in which the combination occurs, the
Company reports provisional amounts for the
items for which the accounting is incomplete.
Those provisional amounts are adjusted through
goodwill during the measurement period, or
additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to

## Summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information on the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024

reflect new information obtained about facts and
circumstances that existed at the acquisition date
that, if known, would have affected the amounts
recognised at that date. These adjustments are
called as measurement period adjustments. The
measurement period does not exceed one year
from the acquisition date.


### 3.12 Government grants

Grants from the Government are recognised when
there is reasonable assurance that all underlying
conditions will be complied with and that the grant
will be received.

Grants related to income are recognised as income
on a systematic basis in the Statement of Profit and
Loss over the periods necessary to match them
with the related costs, which they are intended to
compensate and are presented as 'Other operating
revenues. Further, where loans or similar assistance
are provided by Government or related institutions,
with an interest rate below the current applicable
market rate, the effect of this favorable interest
is regarded as a government grant. The loan or
assistance is initially recognised and measured at fair
value and the government grant is measured as the
difference between the initial carrying value of the
loan and the proceeds to be received. That grant is
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss under
'other operating revenue'. The loan is subsequently
measured in the year of disbursement as per the
accounting policy applicable to financial liabilities.

Government grants related to assets are presented
in the balance sheet by deducting the grant from the
carrying value of the asset and non-monetary grant
is recognised at a nominal value.


### 3.13 Income taxes

Tax expense is the aggregate amount included in
the determination of profit or loss for the period in
respect of current tax and deferred tax.


#### Current income tax

Current income tax is measured at the amount expected
to be paid to the tax authorities in accordance with
the Income-tax Act, 1961 and rules thereunder. Current
income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the
amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the
taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used
to compute the amount are those that are enacted or

substantively enacted, at the reporting date. Current
income tax relating to items recognised outside profit
or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in OCI
or in equity).

Current tax items are recognised in correlation to the
underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.
Management periodically evaluates positions taken
in the tax returns with respect to situations in which
applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation
and establishes provisions where appropriate including
amount expected to be paid/recovered for uncertain
tax position.


##### Deferred tax

Deferred tax is provided using the liability method
on temporary differences between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and their book bases. Deferred
tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary
differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits
and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that
taxable profit will be available against which the
deductible temporary differences, and the carry
forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses
can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply
in the year when the asset is realised or the liability
is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that
have been enacted or substantively enacted at the
reporting date.

Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside
profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss.
Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to
the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly
in equity.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is
reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient
taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of
the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised
deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting
date and are recognised to the extent that it has
become probable that future taxable profits will
allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are
offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off

<figure>

<!-- PageNumber="V3 WARUN SEWERAGES" -->

</figure>


## Summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information on the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024

current tax assets against current tax liabilities and
the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity
and the same taxation authority.

Minimum Alternate Tax ("MAT") credit is recognised
as an asset only when and to the extent there is
convincing evidence that the relevant members of
the Company will pay normal income tax during
the specified period. Such asset is reviewed at each
reporting period end and the adjusted based on
circumstances then prevailing.


### Deferred tax on business combination

When a liability assumed is recognized at the
acquisition date but the related costs are not
deducted in determining taxable profits until a later
period, a deductible temporary difference arises
which results in a deferred tax asset. A deferred tax
asset also arises when the fair value of an identifiable
asset acquired is less than its tax base. In both cases,
the resulting deferred tax asset affects goodwill.


#### 3.14 Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner
consistent with the internal reporting provided to the
chief operating decision maker, who is responsible
for allocating resources and assessing performance
of the operating segments. The business activities
of the Company predominantly fall within a single
operating segment, i.e., manufacturing and sale of
beverages within India.


#### 3.15 Impairment of non-financial assets

The Company assesses, at each reporting date,
whether there is an indication that an asset may be
impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual
impairment testing for an asset is required, the
Company estimates the asset's recoverable amount.
An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an
asset's or cash-generating unit's ("CGU") fair value
less costs of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable
amount is determined for an individual asset, unless
the asset does not generate cash inflows that are
largely independent of those from other assets or
groups of assets.

When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU
exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is
considered impaired and is written down to its
recoverable amount.

In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash
flows are discounted to their present value using a
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and the
risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value
less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are
taken into account. If no such transactions can be
identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.
These calculations are corroborated by valuation
multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded
Company's or other available fair value indicators.

The Company bases its impairment calculation on
detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which
are prepared separately for each of the Company's
CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated.
These budgets and forecast calculations generally
cover a period of five years. For longer periods, a
long-term growth rate is calculated and applied
to project future cash flows after the fifth year. To
estimate cash flow projections beyond periods
covered by the most recent budgets/forecasts, the
Company extrapolates cash flow projections in the
budget using a steady or declining growth rate for
subsequent years, unless an increasing rate can
be justified. In any case, this growth rate does not
exceed the long-term average growth rate for the
products, industries, or country or countries in which
the entity operates, or for the market in which the
asset is used.

Impairment losses of continuing operations,
including impairment on inventories, are recognised
in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

An assessment is made at each reporting date
to determine whether there is an indication that
previously recognised impairment losses no longer
exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the
Company estimates the asset's or CGU's recoverable
amount. A previously recognised impairment
loss is reversed only if there has been a change in
the assumptions used to determine the asset's
recoverable amount since the last impairment
loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that
the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed
its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined, net
of depreciation, had no impairment loss been
recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal

<!-- PageHeader="CORPORATE OVERVIEW" -->


## Summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information on the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024

is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss
unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in
which case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation
increase.


### 3.16 Financial instruments

A financial instrument is any contract that gives
rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial
liability or equity instrument of another entity.


#### Financial assets


#### Initial recognition and measurement

All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value,
plus in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair
value through profit or loss ("FVTPL"), transaction
costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the
financial asset. However, trade receivables that do
not contain a significant financing component are
measured at transaction price.

For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial
assets are classified as follows:


#### a) Debt instruments at amortised cost

A 'debt instrument' is measured at the
amortised cost where the asset is held within
a business model whose objective is to hold
assets for collecting contractual cash flows;
and contractual terms of the asset give rise to
cash flows on specified dates that are solely
payments of principal and interest.

After initial measurement, such financial assets
are subsequently measured at amortised
cost using the EIR method. Amortised cost is
calculated by taking into account any discount
or premium on acquisition and fees or costs
that are an integral part of the EIR. The interest
income from these financial assets is included
in finance income in the Statement of Profit and
Loss. The losses arising from impairment are
recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
This category generally applies to trade and
other receivables.


#### b) Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income

Assets that are held for collection of contractual
cashflows and for selling the financial assets,
where the cash flow represent solely payments

of principal and interest, are measured at fair
value through other comprehensive income
("FVOCI"). The Company has not designated
any debt instrument in this category.


#### c) Debt instruments at fair value through profit or loss

Fair Value Through Profit or Loss ("FVTPL") is
a residual category for debt instruments. Any
debt instrument, which does not meet the
criteria for categorisation as at amortized cost
or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.

In addition, the Company may elect to
designate a debt instrument which otherwise
meets amortized cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at
FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if
doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement
or recognition inconsistency (referred to as
'accounting mismatch').

Debt instruments included within the FVTPL
category are measured at fair value with all
changes recognised in the Statement of Profit
and Loss. The Company has not designated any
debt instrument in this category.


#### d) Equity instruments

All equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109 are
measured at fair value. Equity instruments which
are held for trading and contingent consideration
recognised by an acquirer in a business
combination to which Ind AS 103 'Business
Combinations' applies are Ind AS classified as
at FVTPL. Equity instruments included within
the FVTPL category are measured at fair value
with all changes recognised in the Statement of
Profit and Loss.

For all other equity instruments, the Company
may make an irrevocable election to present
in other comprehensive income subsequent
changes in the fair values. The Company makes
such election on an instrument-by-instrument
basis. The classification is made on initial
recognition and is irrevocable.

If the Company decides to classify an equity
instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value
changes on the instrument, excluding dividends,

<!-- PageFooter="Annual Report 2024 365" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->


<figure>

<!-- PageHeader="V3 WARUN BEVERAGES" -->

</figure>


## Summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information on the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024

are recognised in the OCI. There is no recycling
of the amounts from OCI to profit or loss, even
on sale of investment. However, the Company
may transfer the cumulative gain or loss
within equity.


### De-recognition

A financial asset is de-recognised when the
contractual rights to receive cash flows from the asset
have expired or the Company has transferred its rights
to receive the contractual cash flows from the asset in
a transaction in which substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership of the asset are transferred.


### Impairment of financial assets

The Company measures the Expected Credit Loss
("ECL") associated with its assets based on historical
trends, industry practices and the general business
environment in which it operates. The impairment
methodology applied depends on whether there
has been a significant increase in credit risk. ECL
impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognised
during the period is recognised as income/ expense
in the Statement of Profit and Loss under the head
'other expenses'.


### Financial liabilities


#### Initial recognition and measurement

Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition,
as financial liabilities at fair value through profit
or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as
derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an
effective hedge, as appropriate.

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair
value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and
payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

The Company's financial liabilities include trade and
other payables, loans and borrowings including bank
overdrafts and derivative financial instruments.


#### Subsequent measurement

The measurement of financial liabilities depends on
their classification, as described below:


##### a) Financial liabilities at FVTPL

Financial liabilities at FVTPL include financial
liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities
designated upon initial recognition as at fair
value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities
are classified as held for trading if they are
incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the
near term.

This category includes derivative financial
instruments entered into by the Company that
are not designated as hedging instruments in
hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109.

Financial liabilities designated upon initial
recognition at fair value through profit or loss
are designated as such at the initial date of
recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109
are satisfied. For liabilities designated as FVTPL,
fair value gains/ losses are recognised in the
Statement of Profit and Loss, except for those
attributable to changes in own credit risk, which
are recognised in OCI. These gains/ loss are not
subsequently transferred to the Statement of
Profit and Loss.


##### b) Financial liabilities at amortised cost

After initial recognition, financial liabilities
designated at amortised costs are subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the EIR
method. Gains and losses are recognised in
Statement of Profit and Loss when the liabilities
are derecognised as well as through the EIR
amortisation process.

Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account
any discount or premium on acquisition and fees
or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The
amortisation is included as finance costs in the
Statement of Profit and Loss.


###### De-recognition

A financial liability is derecognised when the
obligation under the liability is discharged or
cancelled or expires. When an existing financial
liability is replaced by another from the same
lender on substantially different terms, or the terms
of an existing liability are substantially modified,
such an exchange or modification is treated as
the de-recognition of the original liability and the
recognition of a new liability. The difference in the
respective carrying amounts is recognised in the
Statement of Profit and Loss.


###### Offsetting of financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and
the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if
there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset
the recognised amounts and there is an intention to
settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle
the liabilities simultaneously.

### 3.17 Investment in subsidiaries, joint venture and associates

An investor, regardless of the nature of its involvement
with an entity (the investee), shall determine whether it
is a parent by assessing whether it controls the investee.
An investor controls an investee when it is exposed, or
has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with
the investee and has the ability to affect those returns
through its power over the investee.

Thus, an investor controls an investee if and only if the
investor has all the following:

a)
power over the investee;

b)
exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its
involvement with the investee; and

c)
the ability to use its power over the investee to
affect the amount of the investor's returns.

An associate is an entity over which the Company
has significant influence. Significant influence is the
power to participate in the financial and operating
policy decisions of the investee, but not control or joint
control over those policies. The considerations made
in determining significant influence are similar to those
necessary to determine control over subsidiaries.

The Company has elected to recognise its investments
in subsidiary, joint venture and associate companies at
cost in accordance with the option available in Ind AS
27, 'Separate Financial Statements'.

Investment carried at cost is tested for impairment as
per Ind-AS 36.


### 3.18 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet
comprise cash at banks and on hand, cheques
on hand and short-term deposits with an original
maturity of three months or less, which are subject
to an insignificant risk of changes in value. For the
purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and
cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term
deposits, as defined above.


### 3.19 Dividend distribution to equity holders

The Company recognises a liability to make cash
or non-cash distributions to equity holders when
the distribution is authorised and the distribution
is no longer at the discretion of the Company. As
per the corporate laws in India, a distribution is

authorised when it is approved by the shareholders. A
corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity.


### 3.20 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Company has
a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a
result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow
of resources embodying economic benefits will
be required to settle the obligation and a reliable
estimate can be made of the amount of the
obligation. When the Company expects some or
all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example,
under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is
recognised as a separate asset, but only when the
reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense
relating to a provision is presented in the Statement
of Profit and Loss, net of any reimbursement.

If the effect of the time value of money is material,
provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax
rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks
specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the
increase in the provision due to the passage of time
is recognised as a finance cost.


### 3.21 Contract liabilities

A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods
or services to a customer for which the Company has
received consideration or is due from the customer. If
a customer pays consideration before the Company
transfers goods or services to the customer, a
contract liability is recognised when the payment is
made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier).
Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when
the Company performs under the contract.


### 3.22 Contingent liabilities

A contingent liability is a possible obligation that
arises from past events whose existence will be
confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence
of one or more uncertain future events beyond the
control of the Company or a present obligation that
is not recognised because it is not probable that
an outflow of resources will be required to settle
the obligation. A contingent liability also arises
in extremely rare cases where there is a liability
that cannot be recognised because it cannot be
measured reliably. The Company does not recognize
a contingent liability but discloses its existence in
the financial statements. Contingent assets are only
disclosed when it is probable that the economic
benefits will flow to the entity.

## Summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information on the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024


### 3.23 Earnings per share

Basic earnings/ (loss) per share are calculated by
dividing the net profit or loss for the year attributable
to equity shareholders by the weighted average
number of equity shares outstanding during the
year. The weighted average number of equity shares
outstanding during the year is adjusted for events,
other than conversion of potential equity shares,
that have changed the number of equity shares
outstanding without a corresponding change in
resources.

In case of a bonus issue and sub-divison/split, the
number of ordinary shares outstanding is increased
by number of shares issued as bonus shares and
sub-divison/split respectively in current year and
comparative period presented as if the event
had occurred at the beginning of the earliest year
presented.

For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings/
(loss) per share, the net profit or loss for the period
attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted
average number of shares outstanding during the
period are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive
potential equity shares.


### 3.24 Significant management judgement in applying accounting policies and estimation uncertainty

The preparation of the Company's financial
statements requires management to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets
and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and
the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of
the financial statements. Estimates and assumptions
are continuously evaluated and are based on
management's experience and other factors,
including expectations of future events that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates
could result in outcomes that require a material
adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or
liabilities affected in future periods.

In particular, the Company has identified the
following areas where significant judgements,
estimates and assumptions are required. Further
information on each of these areas and how they

impact the various accounting policies are described
below and also in the relevant notes to the financial
statements. Changes in estimates are accounted for
prospectively.


#### i) Judgements

In the process of applying the Company's
accounting policies, management has made
the following judgements, which have the most
significant effect on the amounts recognised in
the financial statements:


#### a) Contingencies

Contingent liabilities may arise from the
ordinary course of business in relation to
claims against the Company, including legal,
contractor, land access and other claims. By
their nature, contingencies will be resolved
only when one or more uncertain future
events occur or fail to occur. The assessment
of the existence, and potential quantum,
of contingencies inherently involves the
exercise of significant judgments and the
use of estimates regarding the outcome of
future events.


#### b) Recognition of deferred tax assets

The extent to which deferred tax assets can
be recognised is based on an assessment
of the probability that future taxable
income will be available against which
the deductible temporary differences and
tax loss carry-forward can be utilised. In
addition, significant judgement is required
in assessing the impact of any legal or
economic limits or uncertainties in various
tax jurisdictions.


#### ii) Estimates and assumptions

The key assumptions concerning the future and
other key sources of estimation uncertainty
at the reporting date that have a significant
risk of causing a material adjustment to the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within
the next financial year, are described below.
The Company based its assumptions and
estimates on parameters available when the
financial statements were prepared. Existing
circumstances and assumptions about future

developments, however, may change due to
market change or circumstances arising beyond
the control of the Company. Such changes are
reflected in the assumptions when they occur.


### a) Useful lives of tangible/intangible assets

The Company reviews its estimate of the
useful lives of tangible/intangible assets at
each reporting date, based on the expected
utility of the assets.


### b) Defined benefit obligation

The cost of the defined benefit plan and
other post-employment benefits and
the present value of such obligation are
determined using actuarial valuations.
An actuarial valuation involves making
various assumptions that may differ from
actual developments in the future. These
include the determination of the discount
rate, future salary increases, mortality rates
and future pension increases. In view of
the complexities involved in the valuation
and its long-term nature, a defined benefit
obligation is highly sensitive to changes
in these assumptions. All assumptions are
reviewed at each reporting date.


### c) Inventories

The Company estimates the net realisable
values of inventories, taking into account
the most reliable evidence available at each
reporting date. The future realisation of
these inventories may be affected by future
technology or other market-driven changes
that may reduce future selling prices.


### d) Business combinations

The Company uses valuation techniques
when determining the fair values of certain
assets and liabilities acquired in a business
combination.


### e) Impairment of non-financial assets and goodwill

In assessing impairment, Company
estimates the recoverable amount of each
asset or cash-generating units based on
expected future cash flows and uses an
interest rate to discount them. Estimation
uncertainty relates to assumptions
about future operating results and the
determination of a suitable discount rate.


### f) Fair value measurement of financial instruments

When the fair values of financial assets
and financial liabilities recorded in the
Balance Sheet cannot be measured based
on quoted prices in active markets, their
fair value is measured using valuation
techniques including the DCF model. The
inputs to these models are taken from
observable markets where possible, but
where this is not feasible, a degree of
judgment is required in establishing fair
values. Judgements include considerations
of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk
and volatility. Changes in assumptions
about these factors could affect the
reported fair value of financial instruments.

i. Goodwill and franchise rights/trade marks with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually, or
more frequently if the events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. The useful
life of an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually to determine whether the useful
life assessment continues to be supportable.


The Company has considered the relevant provisions of Ind AS 38 on 'Intangibles Assets' which provides factors to
determine the life of intangible assets and accordingly the carrying value of franchisee rights have been considered
to have an indefinite life. These franchisee rights meet the prescribed criteria of renewal at nominal cost, renewal
with no specific conditions attached, are sustainable and the same is supported by evidences of being renewed.
Management is of the opinion that, based on an analysis of all the relevant factors, there is no foreseeable limit to
the period over which the franchise rights are expected to generate net cash inflows for the Company.

The assumptions used in this impairment assessment are most sensitive to following:

a) Weighted average cost of capital "WACC" of 16.45% (Previous year - 13.33%) for the explicit period and
16.45% (Previous year - 13.33%) for the terminal year.

b) For arriving at the terminal value, approximate growth rate of 6% (Previous year - 5%) is considered.

c) Number of years for which cash flows were considered are 5 years.

d) The approximate rate of growth in sales is estimated at 8%-10% (Previous year - 8%-10%) in the discrete
period.

No impairment loss was identified on the above assessment.

falls in the range of 0 to 120 days from the completion of performance obligation.

### 37. Gratuity and other post-employment benefit plans


#### Gratuity:

The Company has a defined benefit gratuity plan governed by the Payments of Gratuity Act, 1972. Every employee
who has completed five years or more of services is eligible for gratuity on separation at 15 days salary (last drawn
salary) for each completed year of service. The Company has formed a Gratuity Trust to which contribution is made
and an insurance policy is taken by the trust, which is a year-on-year cash accumulation plan in which the interest rate is
declared on yearly basis and is guaranteed for a period of one year. The insurance company, as part of the policy rules,
makes payment of all gratuity outflow during the year (subject to sufficiency of funds under the policy). The policy,
thus, mitigates the liquidity risk. However, being a cash accumulation plan, the duration of assets is shorter compared
to the duration of liabilities. Thus, the Company is exposed to movement in interest rate (particularly, the significant fall
in interest rates, which should result in a increase in liability without corresponding increase in the asset. The Company
makes a provision of unfunded liability based on actuarial valuation in the Balance Sheet as part of employee cost.

42\. Pursuant to transfer pricing legislations under the Income-tax Act, 1961, the Company is required to use specified
methods for computing arm's length price in relation to specified international and domestic transactions with its
associated enterprises. Further, the Company is required to maintain prescribed information and documents in
relation to such transactions. The appropriate method to be adopted will depend on the nature of transactions/
class of transactions, class of associated persons, functions performed and other factors, which have been
prescribed. The Company is in the process of updating its transfer pricing documentation for the current financial
year. Based on the preliminary assessment, the management is of the view that the update would not have a
material impact on the tax expense recorded in these financial statements. Accordingly, these financial statements
do not include any adjustments for the transfer pricing implications, if any.

## Summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information on the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2024


### 44. Disclosure on lease transactions pursuant to Ind AS 116 - Leases

The Company's lease asset class primarily consists of leases for land, buildings and plant and equipment. With the
exception of short-term leases, leases of low-value and cancellable long-term leases underlying assets, each lease
is reflected on the balance sheet as a right of use asset and a lease liability.

Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the weighted
average borrowing rate ranging 5.44-8.22% (31 December 2023: 5.44-8.22% ).

Each lease generally imposes a restriction that, unless there is a contractual right for the Company to sublet the
asset to another party, the right of use asset can only be used by the Company. Leases are either non-cancellable
or may only be cancelled by incurring a substantive termination fee. Some leases contain an option to extend
the lease for a further term. The Company is prohibited from selling or pledging the underlying leased assets
otherthan leasehold lands as security against the Company's other debts and liabilities.

The risk-free interest rate (continuous compounding) being considered for the calculation is the interest rate
applicable for maturity equal to the expected life of the options on the date of grant of options based on the
zero-coupon yield curve for Government Securities available as on Valuation date taken from www.ccilindia.com.

The measure of volatility used in the Option-Pricing Model is the annualised standard
deviation of the continuous rates of return on the stock over a period of time.

#### 52. Financial instruments risk


##### Financials risk management objectives and policies

The Company is exposed to various risks in relation to financial instruments. The main types of financial risks are
market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.

The management of the Company monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the
Company on a continuous basis. The Company's risk management is coordinated at its head office, in close
cooperation with the management, and focuses on actively securing the Company's short to medium-term cash
flows and simultaneously minimising the exposure to volatile financial markets. Long-term financial investments
are managed to generate lasting returns.

The Company does not engage in the trading of financial assets for speculative purposes. The most significant
financial risks to which the Company is exposed are described below.


##### 52.1 Market risk analysis

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
changes in market prices. The Company is exposed to market risk through its use of financial instruments and
specifically to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk which result from its operating,
investing and financing activities. Contracts to hedge exposures in foreign currencies, interest rates etc. are
entered into wherever considered necessary by the management.


##### Foreign currency risk

Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of
changes in foreign exchange rates. The functional currency of the Company is Indian Rupees ('INR' or '?'). Most of
the Company's transactions are carried out in Indian Rupees. Exposures to currency exchange rates mainly arise
from the Company's overseas sales and purchases, lending to overseas subsidiary companies, external commercial
borrowings etc. which are primarily denominated in US Dollars ('USD'), Pound Sterling ('GBP'), Australian Dollars
('AUD'), Euro ('EUR'), Emirati Dirham ('AED') and South African Rand ('ZAR').

The Company has limited exposure to foreign currency risk and thereby it mainly relies on natural hedge. To
further mitigate the Company's exposure to foreign currency risk, non-INR cash flows are continuously monitored
and derivative contracts are entered into wherever considered necessary.

The following table illustrates the foreign currency sensitivity of profit and equity with regards to the Company's
financial assets and financial liabilities considering 'all other things being equal' and ignoring the impact of taxation.
It assumes a +/- 1% change of the INR/USD, INR/AUD, INR/GBP, INR/EUR, INR/AED and INR/ZAR exchange rate
for the year ended at 31 December 2024 (31 December 2023: 1%). These are the sensitivity rates used when
reporting foreign currency exposures internally to the key management personnel and represents management's
assessment of the reasonably possible changes in the foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes
only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items at end of each period reported upon. A positive
number indicates an increase in profit or equity and vice-versa.

Exposures to foreign exchange rates vary during the year depending on the volume of the overseas transactions.
Nonetheless, the analysis above is considered to be representative of the Company's exposure to currency risk.


### Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because
of changes in market interest rates. The Company's policy is to minimise interest rate cash flow risk exposures on
long-term financing. The Company is exposed to changes in market interest rates as some of the bank and other
borrowings are at variable interest rates and also loans have been advanced to subsidiary companies at variable
interest rates. All the Company's term deposits are at fixed interest rates.

The following table illustrates the sensitivity of profit and equity to a reasonably possible change in interest
rates of +/- 1% (31 December 2023: +/- 1%). These changes are considered to be reasonably possible based on
management's assessment. The calculations are based on a change in the average market interest rate for each
period, and the financial instruments held at each reporting date that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. All
other variables are held constant.

### Commodity price risk

The Company is affected by the price volatility of certain commodities. Its operating activities require the ongoing
purchase of pet chips and sugar and therefore require a continuous supply. In view of volatility of pet chips and
sugar prices, the Company also executes into various advance purchase contracts.


### Commodity price sensitivity

### Other price sensitivity

The Company is not exposed to any listed equity or listed debt price risk as it does not hold any investments in
listed entities.


### 52.2 Credit risk analysis

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty fails to discharge an obligation to the Company. The Company is operating
through a network of distributors and other distribution partners based at different locations. The Company is
exposed to this risk for various financial instruments, for example loans granted, receivables from customers,
deposits placed etc. The Company's maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial
assets recognised at end of each reporting period, as summarised below:

The Company continuously monitors receivables and defaults of customers and other counterparties, and
incorporates this information into its credit risk controls. Appropriate security deposits are kept against the
supplies to customers and balances are reconciled at regular intervals. The Company's policy is to deal only with
creditworthy counterparties.

In respect of trade and other receivables, the Company is not exposed to any significant credit risk exposure to
any single counterparty. Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers of various scales and in different
geographical areas. Based on historical information about customer default rates, management considers the
credit quality of trade receivables. In case the receivables are not recovered even after regular follow up, measures
are taken to stop further supplies to the concerned customer. The expected credit loss is based on the five years
historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward
looking estimates. Further, the Company has assessed the recoverability of grants receivable classified under
other current financial assets and accordingly provided for balance overdue for more than three years, amounting
to ₹ 236.45 million (31 December 2023: Nil).

The credit risk for cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits including interest accrued thereon and Government
grant receivables is considered negligible, since the counterparties are reputable banks with high quality external
credit ratings and State Government bodies. The credit risk for loans advanced to subsidiary companies including
interest accrued thereon is also considered negligible since operations of these entities are regularly monitored by
the Company and these companies have shown considerable growth.

In respect of financial guarantees provided by the Company, the maximum exposure which the Company is
exposed to is the maximum amount which the Company would have to pay if the guarantee is called upon. Based
on the expectation at the end of each reporting period, the Company considers that it is more likely than not that
such an amount will not be payable under the guarantees provided.


#### 52.3 Liquidity risk analysis

Liquidity risk is that the Company might be unable to meet its obligations. The Company manages its liquidity needs by
monitoring scheduled debt servicing payments for long-term financial liabilities and considering the maturity profiles
of financial assets and other financial liabilities as well as forecast of operational cash inflows and outflows. Liquidity
needs are monitored in various time bands, on a day-to-day basis, a week-to-week basis and a month-to-month basis.
Long-term liquidity needs for a 180-day and a 360-day lookout period are identified monthly. Net cash requirements
are compared to available borrowing facilities in order to determine headroom or any shortfalls.

Funding for long-term liquidity needs is additionally secured by an adequate amount of committed credit facilities
and the Company's ability to avail further credit facilities subject to creation of requisite charge on its assets. The
Company assessed the concentration of risk with respect to refinancing its debt and concluded it to be low.

As at 31 December 2024, the Company's non-derivative financial liabilities have contractual undiscounted maturities

#### Valuation technique to determine fair value

"Cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances, trade receivables, loans, other current financial assets, trade
payables, current borrowings and other current financial liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due
to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is the amount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced
or liquidation sale.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:

. The fair values of the long term borrowings, loans and other deferred payments are determined by using
discounted cash flow method using the appropriate discount rate. The discount rate is determined using
other similar instruments incorporating the risk associated.


#### Fair value hierarchy

The financial assets measured at fair value are grouped into the fair value hierarchy as on 31 December 2024 and

the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) framework. Certain limitations
inherent to the subject matter and the assurance process were identified, as detailed below;

financial figures from the audited financial reports, and VBL will be responsible for the
appropriate application of this financial data. DEKRA assumes no liability for the accuracy or
completeness of the financial data contained within the Company's audited financial report.

. This assurance statement's applicability is restricted to the context defined by SEBI circular
SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-SEC-2/P/CIR/2023/122 (July 12, 2023) and the Industry Standards for

##### Inherit Limitation

Inherent limitations in preparing the Company's BRSR information requires the management to
establish or interpret the criteria, make determinations about the relevancy of information to be
included, and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported information.

Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR Core metrics, some of which are estimates, is subject
to substantial inherent measurement uncertainty, for example, GHG emissions, water footprint,
energy footprint. Obtaining sufficient appropriate evidence to support our opinion/conclusion does not
reduce the uncertainty in the amounts and metrics.

### Observations and Findings

In addition to providing limited assurance, we noted the following observations during our engagement:

· Stakeholder Inclusivity:

We found no evidence of any key stakeholder groups being excluded from VBL's stakeholder engagement
process. VBL has demonstrated a proactive and inclusive approach, ensuring that diverse stakeholder
perspectives are considered throughout their sustainability strategy and reporting efforts.

· Materiality:

We are not aware of any significant material issues concerning VBL's sustainability performance that have been
omitted from the report. VBL has thoroughly identified and addressed relevant material sustainability topics,
ensuring transparency and alignment with both stakeholder expectations and industry standards.

· Responsiveness:

VBL has established robust processes to effectively respond to stakeholder concerns and manage its material
sustainability issues. However, the assessment was focused on the verification of the selected KPIs and did not
extend beyond the agreed scope of assurance.

· Impact:

VBL has implemented effective processes to measure, evaluate, and manage the environmental and social
impacts associated with its operations. These processes are aligned with key performance indicators (KPIs)
relevant to the nature of its business and identified material sustainability issues.

· Reliability:

Data management systems are established and centralized for the collection and calculation of data associated
with the selected KPIS. These systems provide an adequate foundation for the reliability of the reported data,
though certain operational data depend on measurement arrangements at the site level.


### Limitations and Exclusions

Excluded from the scope of our work is assurance of information relating to:

· Activities outside the defined assurance period.

· Positional statements of a descriptive or interpretative nature, or of opinion, belief, aspiration, or commitment
to undertake future actions.

· Other information included in the report other than the universal disclosures (GRI-2 and GRI-3) and disclosures
related to material topics and mentioned disclosures.

. Since VBL had a conclusive third-party verification report available for selected key performance indicators of
few material topics, as part of Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) Core reporting, the same
were not repeated during DQS verification.

The following limitations should be noted:

. This limited assurance engagement relies on a risk-based selected sample of sustainability data and the
associated limitations that this entails.

· The reliability of the reported data is dependent on the accuracy of metering and other production measurement
arrangements employed at site level, which were not addressed as part of this assurance.

· This independent statement should not be relied upon to detect all errors, omissions, or misstatements that
may exist.


### Conclusion

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the selected Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs), as outlined above and reported in the VBL Sustainability Report 2024, are not presented fairly,
in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable criteria.

management principles. The assurance assessments are the only work undertaken by DQS for VBL, thus safeguarding
our independence and impartiality throughout the engagement.
