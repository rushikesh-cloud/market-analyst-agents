looking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as "future," "anticipates," "believes,"
"estimates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "predicts," "will," "would," "could," "can," "may," and similar terms. Forward-
looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company's actual results may differ significantly from the
results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to,
those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading "Risk Factors." The Company assumes no obligation to
revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.

##### Payment Services

#### Segments

The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable segments consist of the
Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe
includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong
and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia, New Zealand and those Asian countries not included in the Company's other
reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services,
each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company's customers and distribution partners and the
unique market dynamics of each geographic region.


#### Markets and Distribution

The Company's customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government
markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers
through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company sells its services in the same markets through its
various service platforms. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular
network carriers and other resellers, for the sale of its products and certain of its services. During 2025, the Company's net sales
through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 40% and 60%, respectively, of total net sales.


#### Competition

The markets for the Company's products and services are highly competitive and are characterized by aggressive price
competition, downward pressure on gross margins, continual improvement in product performance, and price sensitivity on the
part of consumers and businesses. The markets in which the Company competes are further defined by frequent introduction of
new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, and rapid adoption of technological
advancements by competitors. Many of the Company's competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and
very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company's products and infringing on its intellectual property.

<!-- PageFooter="Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 2" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

The Company's ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative
new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for
its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal
competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative
price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design and technology innovation, a strong third-party software
and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, corporate reputation, and the ability to
effectively protect and enforce the Company's intellectual property rights.

The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables
and accessories, and services. The Company's products and services face substantial competition from companies that have
significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings
with large customer bases. In addition, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company's product
features and applications within their products to offer more competitive solutions. The Company also expects competition to
intensify as competitors imitate the Company's approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work
collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. Some of the Company's competitors have broad product lines, low-priced products,
large installed bases of active devices, and large customer bases. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have
aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to
provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company has a minority market share in the global
smartphone, personal computer, tablet and wearables markets, and some of the markets in which the Company competes have
from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.


##### Supply of Components

Although most components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, certain
components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with
other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many
components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide
shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. Restrictions on international trade can increase the cost or limit the
availability of the Company's products and the components and rare earths and other raw materials that go into them.

The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by
the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new
technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers' yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have
increased. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, the Company may not be
able to extend or renew agreements for the supply of components on similar terms, or at all, and may not be successful in
obtaining sufficient quantities from its suppliers or in a timely manner, or in identifying and obtaining sufficient quantities from an
alternative source. In addition, component suppliers may fail, be subject to consolidation within a particular industry, or decide to
concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements,
further limiting the Company's ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.


#### Research and Development

Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company's
ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products,
services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing
products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development ("R&D"), licensing of
intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.


#### Intellectual Property

The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware, software
and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property rights
in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an
important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies
primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.

The Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its
hardware, software and service research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of
applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual
property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company's products
and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its
products and services.

<!-- PageFooter="Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 3" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company's products and services include technology or
intellectual property that must be licensed from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating
to various aspects of the Company's products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain
such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the
future on reasonable terms or at all.


#### Business Seasonality and Product Introductions

The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in
part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of
sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company's net sales to its indirect
distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an
older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and
distributors anticipate a product introduction.


#### Human Capital

The Company believes that its people play an important role in its success, and strives to attract, develop and retain the best
talent. The Company works to create a culture of collaboration, one where people with a broad range of backgrounds and
perspectives can come together to innovate and do the best work of their lives. The Company is an equal opportunity employer
committed to inclusion and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination. As of September 27, 2025, the
Company had approximately 166,000 full-time equivalent employees.

The Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and offers discretionary cash and equity awards
to enable employees to share in the Company's success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they
have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support
of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world, including health, wellness and time away.

The Company invests in resources to help its people develop and achieve their career goals. The Company offers programs
through Apple University on leadership, management and influence, as well as Apple culture and values. Team members can
also take advantage of online classes for business, technical and personal development.

The Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an
open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to
come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee
sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusion.

The Company is committed to the safety and security of its team members everywhere it operates. The Company supports
employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those
working in potentially high-hazard environments.

### Item 1A. Risk Factors

The following summarizes factors that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, reputation, results of
operations, financial condition and stock price. The Company may not be able to accurately predict, control or mitigate these
risks. Statements in this section are based on the Company's beliefs and opinions regarding matters that could materially
adversely affect the Company in the future and are not representations as to whether such matters have or have not occurred
previously. The risks and uncertainties described below are not exhaustive and should not be considered a complete statement
of all potential risks or uncertainties that the Company faces or may face in the future.

This section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations" and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, "Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.


#### Macroeconomic and Industry Risks

The Company's operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and
adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations, financial
condition and stock price.

The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales.
In addition, the Company's global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company's supplier facilities, including
manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company's operations and performance depend
significantly on global and regional economic conditions.

Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher
interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely
affect demand for the Company's products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially
adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset
values, and other economic factors.

Uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can also have a significant impact on the Company's
suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and
developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and
insolvency.

Adverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company's trade receivables; the
failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company's ability to issue new debt; reduced
liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company's financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially
adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.

<!-- PageFooter="Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 5" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

The Company's business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical
tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business
interruptions.

Political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health
issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can have a material adverse effect on the Company and its
customers, employees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other
channel partners.

The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company's total net sales,
and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. A significant majority of the Company's
manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South
Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, in addition to sourcing from partners and facilities located in the U.S. Restrictions on international
trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the
Company's business and supply chain. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries
and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations.
Restrictive measures can increase the cost or limit the availability of the Company's products and the components and rare
earths and other raw materials that go into them. Restrictive measures can also require the Company to change suppliers,
restructure business relationships and operations, refrain from offering and distributing or cease to offer and distribute affected
products, services and third-party applications to its customers, and increase the prices of its products and services. Changing
the Company's business and supply chain in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be
expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's business and results of operations. Trade and other international
disputes can also have an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in
consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment for the Company's products and services, all of which can further
adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance
notice, which can create uncertainty, and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate any or all adverse impacts from
such measures. Global supply chains can be highly concentrated, and an escalation of geopolitical tensions or conflict could
result in significant disruptions. Beginning in the second quarter of 2025, new tariffs were announced on imports to the U.S.
("U.S. Tariffs"), including additional tariffs on imports from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the European
Union ("EU"), among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or threatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports
from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S. Tariffs have been announced and further
changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs or other measures. For example, the U.S.
Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended,
into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products,
including downstream products that contain semiconductors. The ultimate impact remains uncertain and will depend on several
factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to what extent
other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the overall magnitude and duration of these
measures. If disputes and conflicts further escalate, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and
restrictive.

Many of the Company's operations, retail stores and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company's suppliers
and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change is
resulting in certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. In
addition, the Company's and its suppliers' operations, retail stores and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire,
power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts,
ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company's
control.

Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create
delays and inefficiencies in the Company's supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company's
service offerings, increase the Company's costs, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas.

The Company's operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While
the Company's suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur
and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company's business, and harm to the Company's reputation.
Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the
future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products;
the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight
services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company's operations, supply chain and sales
and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays
in production ramps of new products and development of new services.

<!-- PageBreak -->

Following any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, incur significant expenditures to
resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and
manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative
consequences to the Company. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance
coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. Any of the foregoing can materially adversely affect the
Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.


##### Global markets for the Company's products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.

The Company's products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets. These markets are characterized by
aggressive price competition, downward pressure on gross margins, continual improvement in product performance, and price
sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. These markets are further defined by frequent introduction of new products
and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, and rapid adoption of technological advancements.

The Company's ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative
new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for
its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the
Company must make significant investments in R&D. These investments may not achieve expected returns, and the Company
may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.

The Company's ability to compete successfully also depends on the effective protection and enforcement of its intellectual
property rights. Regulatory requirements, government investigations and litigation can force the Company to withdraw from, or
modify its products and services for, certain countries and limit its ability to derive value from, or to enjoin others from using, its
intellectual property rights. Additionally, they may require the Company to share its innovations with competitors. Any of these
outcomes can have a negative impact on the Company's competitive advantage and materially adversely affect its business,
results of operations, financial condition and stock price.

The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to
register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company's competitors seek to compete
primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company's products and infringing on
its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the
Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if
competitors infringe on the Company's intellectual property, the Company's ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be
materially adversely affected.

The Company's products and services face substantial competition from companies that have significant technical, marketing,
distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and service offerings. In addition, the Company faces
significant competition as competitors imitate the Company's product features and applications within their products to offer more
competitive solutions. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company's approach to
providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. Some of the
Company's competitors have broad product lines, low-priced products, large installed bases of active devices, and large
customer bases. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product
margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products and services at little or no
profit or even at a loss. The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer, tablet and
wearables markets, and some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no
growth or contracted overall.

If the Company is unable to compete successfully, its business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock
price can be materially adversely affected.

#### Business Risks


##### To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.

Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company
must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively
stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, navigate global regulatory requirements and barriers
to market access, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of
new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including the Company's ability to recruit and retain
highly skilled personnel to execute on its strategic initiatives, and the timely and successful development and market acceptance
of new products, services and technologies. Success also relies on the Company's ability to manage the risks associated with
new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the effective integration of third-party services and technologies into the
Company's products and services, the availability, delivery and performance of application software or other third-party support
for the Company's products and services, the effective management of manufacturing and other purchase commitments and the
management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, and the availability of products in appropriate quantities
and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand. Additionally, quality issues or other defects or deficiencies can adversely
affect the success of new product and service introductions and market acceptance. New products, services and technologies
may replace or supersede existing offerings and may produce lower revenues and lower profit margins. The Company may not
be able to successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services, which can materially adversely
affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.


###### The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.

A significant majority of the Company's manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily
in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, in addition to sourcing from partners and facilities located in
the U.S. The Company relies on single-source partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many
components, and on partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company's hardware
products. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements
can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company's direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished
control has from time to time had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on the cost, quality or quantity of products
manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company's flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although
arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally
remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences
unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code
of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company's
business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.

Changes or additions to the Company's supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and
uncertainties, including exposure to additional regulatory and operational risks.


####### Future operating results depend upon the Company's ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.

Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant
supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to
industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company's
business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the
past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company's ability to obtain sufficient
quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future.

Additionally, the Company's new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component
or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers' yields have matured or their
manufacturing capacities have increased. The Company may not be able to extend or renew agreements for the supply of
components on similar terms, or at all, and may not be successful in obtaining sufficient quantities from its suppliers in a timely
manner, or in identifying and obtaining sufficient quantities from an alternative source. In addition, component suppliers may fail,
be subject to consolidation within a particular industry, or decide to concentrate on the production of common components
instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements, further limiting the Company's ability to obtain sufficient
quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant
risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial
condition and stock price.

<!-- PageBreak -->


###### The Company's products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company's business and result in harm to the Company's reputation.

The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing
defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues
that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist
in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company's
products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the
Company's products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company's service offerings
can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the
Company's services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. The introduction of new and
complex technologies, such as artificial intelligence features, can increase these and other safety risks, including exposing users
to harmful, inaccurate or other negative content and experiences. The Company may not be able to detect and fix all issues and
defects in the hardware, software and services it offers, which can result in widespread technical and performance issues
affecting the Company's products and services. Errors, bugs and vulnerabilities can be exploited by third parties, compromising
the safety and security of a user's device. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product
replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant
warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can adversely affect the
experience for users of the Company's products and services, and result in harm to the Company's reputation, loss of
competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service
introductions and lost sales.


##### The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.

The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories if cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company
reviews other assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers' facilities, inventory prepayments and other long-lived assets,
for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. Although the Company believes
its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets are currently recoverable, the Company may incur write-
downs, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which
the Company competes.

The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments.
Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company's forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for
periods up to 150 days. Because the Company's markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price
changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components
or products, or not fully utilize purchase commitments. The Company accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of
excess products and components.


##### The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.

The Company's products and services include technology or intellectual property that must be licensed from third parties. In
addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may
compete, current extensive intellectual property coverage and the rapid rate of new intellectual property rights generation, the
Company's products and services may be alleged to infringe existing intellectual property rights of others. This risk may be
exacerbated by the use of new and emerging technologies, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, which can
involve, among other things, the acquisition and use of copyrighted materials for training as well as the potential reproduction of
copyrighted materials in their outputs. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain
intellectual property rights of third parties. The Company is not always able to obtain all necessary licenses to third-party
intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual
property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can require the Company to modify certain
products, services or features or preclude the Company from selling certain products or services and expose the Company to
significant licensing costs, all of which can materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations,
financial condition and stock price.

<!-- PageFooter="Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 9" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->


##### The Company's future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.

The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party
software applications and services. Third-party developers may discontinue the development and maintenance of software
applications and services for the Company's products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed
and maintained for the Company's products, customers may choose not to buy the Company's products, adversely impacting the
Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.

The Company believes that third-party developer support depends on the perceived benefits of creating software and services
for the Company's products compared to competitors' platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for
personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on
factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected
future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.

The Company's minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer, tablet and wearables markets can make
developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources
to developing and upgrading software for competitors' products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on
these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company's devices can suffer.

The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its
products. The Company's products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party
developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these
changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower
customer demand for the Company's products.


###### Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company's customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or
offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company's own services.
The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the
continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers
and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or
impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may
seek to limit the Company's access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a
wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.

The Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for
talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company's customers.


####### The Company's success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company's ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture.

Much of the Company's future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and
service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced
personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley,
where most of the Company's key personnel are located. Periods of intense competition for talent in particular fields can lead to
increased costs as the Company seeks to offer competitive compensation to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. In
addition to competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving and the Company must navigate changes
effectively in order to achieve its strategic initiatives. Laws and regulations, including immigration, labor and employment laws
and export controls, among others, can materially adversely affect the Company's ability to recruit and retain a highly skilled,
global workforce. If the Company does not effectively manage changing workforce dynamics and regulatory requirements, it
could materially adversely affect the Company's culture, operational flexibility, strategy and costs, all of which can materially
adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.

The Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to
nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company's ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who
are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of
operations, financial condition and stock price.

<!-- PageFooter="Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 10" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->


##### The Company depends on the performance of carriers and other resellers.

The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers and other resellers, many of
which distribute products and services from competitors. Resellers offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for
users' purchases of devices, and such plans may be discontinued or modified any time.

The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected
resellers' stores with Company employees and contractors, improving product placement displays, and developing and making
digital marketing assets available to resellers. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or
incremental sales. For example, the purchasing preferences and behaviors of consumers may change, the financial condition of
resellers could weaken, resellers could stop distributing the Company's products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or
all of the Company's products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's products, all of
which could materially adversely impact the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.


###### The Company's business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions.

The Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to
information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions,
telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other
cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be
ineffective or inadequate, and the Company's or its vendors' business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be
sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company's business by, among other things,
preventing access to the Company's online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and
shipping of the Company's products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results
of operations, financial condition and stock price.


###### Losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.

The Company's business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal and sensitive health and
financial information with respect to the Company's customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to
systems and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems
and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential
information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial
condition and stock price.

The Company's business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company
relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations.
Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on
the Company's behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential
information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company's business,
reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.

The Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis.
These attacks target the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information and may disrupt normal business
operations. Attacks can impair the Company's ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, affect its stock
price, damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, potentially resulting
in penalties, fines or judgments. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with
increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or
obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company's ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In
addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of geopolitical tensions or conflict.

Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many
companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and
the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.

<!-- PageFooter="Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 11" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

As with all companies, the security the Company has implemented may not be sufficient for all eventualities and are vulnerable
to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities.
For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company's or its suppliers' and other third parties' employees or
customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized
access to the Company's or such suppliers' or third parties' systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company,
the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for
unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or
loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company's products and services.

While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such
insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.


###### Investment in new business strategies, commercial relationships and acquisitions could disrupt the Company's ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated, and materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies, commercial relationships and acquisitions.
Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations,
greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in
new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and
significant write-offs. Some transactions, including investments and acquisitions, are exposed to additional risks, including failing
to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, a counterparty's failure to perform or deliver as anticipated, or
the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit
the Company's ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. New business strategies and ventures are
inherently risky and may not be successful. The Company's business strategies and investments may not be successful, which
could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.


#### Legal and Regulatory Compliance Risks


##### The Company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations.

The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary
course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, the Company
enters into agreements that include indemnification provisions that can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event
of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving
the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased
over time and may continue to increase.

The Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its standards-enabled products,
and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology,
data and other intellectual property asset-holding companies frequently assert their intellectual property rights and seek royalties
and often enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. These risks,
and the risks of novel claims being attempted, may be exacerbated as new and emerging technologies, including machine
learning and artificial intelligence, are further integrated into the Company's products and services. The Company is vigorously
defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs
in these actions frequently seek broad injunctive relief and substantial damages.

Regardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be
expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company
may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. However, such agreements
may not always be available on acceptable terms, and litigation may still arise. Such agreements can also significantly reduce
the Company's revenue and increase the Company's cost of sales and operating expenses, materially adversely affecting the
Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Additionally, such agreements may require the
Company to change its business practices and limit the Company's ability to offer certain products and services.

<!-- PageFooter="Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 12" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against
the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management's expectations, the Company's
results of operations, financial condition and stock price for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further,
such an outcome can result in significant monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures
or injunctive relief against the Company. Adverse resolution of legal matters has from time to time required, and can in the future
require, the Company to change its business practices. It can also limit the Company's ability to enjoin others from using, or to
derive value from, its intellectual property rights, and to develop, manufacture, use, import or offer for sale certain products and
services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial
condition and stock price.

While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to
cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.


###### The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company's business.

The Company's global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide on subjects including
antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; online safety; age verification; consumer protection; advertising, sales,
billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement;
digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media,
television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment;
anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti-money laundering;
foreign ownership and investment; national security; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste,
recycling, product design and climate change.

Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws, regulations, executive orders,
directives, and enforcement priorities can adversely affect the Company's business by increasing the Company's costs, limiting
the Company's ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company's
products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company's products and services, and requiring changes to the
Company's business or supply chain. New and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement
priorities can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. If the Company is
found to have violated such laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results
of operations, financial condition and stock price.

Risks and costs related to new and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement priorities increase
as the Company's products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services, or
as the Company expands the use of technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence features, and must
navigate new legal, regulatory and ethical considerations relating to such technologies.

Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company's business may be announced with little or
no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For
example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. The Company's
programs, policies and procedures may not be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the
Company's products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the
Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.


###### Varied stakeholder expectations about social and other issues expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company's business.

Various stakeholders, including governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and others, have differing
expectations about a wide range of social and other issues related to the Company's business. The Company makes statements
about its values, including the environmental and societal impact of its business, through various reports, information provided on
the Company's website, and in press statements and other communications. The Company also pursues environmental and
other goals and initiatives that involve risks and uncertainties, require investments, and depend in part on third-party
performance or data that is outside the Company's control, and the Company may not be able to fully achieve all of its goals and
initiatives. Efforts by the Company to advance its business and values, or achieve its goals and further its initiatives, or to align
with stakeholders' expectations, or comply with evolving, varied and at times conflicting federal, state and international laws,
executive orders, regulations and standards, or any failure or perceived failure to do so, can result in adverse reactions by
consumers and other stakeholders, including the commencement of legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company, and
can materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.

###### The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.

From time to time, the Company has made changes to its business, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition,
market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future.
For example, in the U.S., the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps
on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms and is currently subject to
a court order preventing it from imposing any commission or fee on certain purchases that consumers make.

Globally, several jurisdictions have adopted, or may in the future adopt, competition-related laws and regulations imposing wide-
ranging obligations on technology companies and significant limitations on businesses, including the Company. For example, the
Company has implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safari® in the EU as it seeks to comply with the Digital
Markets Act ("DMA"), including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods
of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company's operating systems, and
additional tools and application programming interfaces for developers. The Company has also continued to make changes to its
compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission. Although the Company's compliance plan is
intended to address the DMA's obligations, it has been challenged by the Commission and may be challenged further by private
litigants. The DMA provides for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance. While the changes introduced by the Company
in the EU are intended to reduce new privacy and security risks that the DMA poses to EU users, many risks will remain.
Changes to the Company's business in response to the DMA or other laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the
Company's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.

The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around the world, which can
result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse
impact on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. For example, the Company is
subject to civil antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for "performance
smartphones" and "smartphones" generally in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. In addition, the Company is the subject of
investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations or litigation are
resolved against the Company, the Company can be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes
to its business practices, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations,
financial condition and stock price.

Further, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become
subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the
Company's commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company's business,
results of operations, financial condition and stock price. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements
with Google LLC ("Google") and other companies to offer their search services on the Company's platforms and applications,
and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings. On August 5, 2024,
Google was found to have violated U.S. antitrust laws. In connection with this finding, on September 2, 2025, the U.S. District
Court for the District of Columbia ("D.C. District Court") ordered certain remedies. The court's order is subject to further
proceedings before the D.C. District Court, which may result in changes to the interpretation or application of the remedies
ordered by the court, as well as new or changed remedies being ordered. The court's order is also subject to appeal by both the
U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and Google. A reversal of the order on appeal could result in imposition of certain remedies
initially proposed by the DOJ, such as those prohibiting Google from offering the Company commercial terms for search
distribution. If implemented, these remedies could materially adversely affect the Company's ability to earn revenue from such
licensing arrangements.

The Company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially adversely affected,
individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the
future. Changes to the Company's business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with legal
proceedings can negatively impact the reputation of the Company's products for privacy and security. Such changes in business
practices can also otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company's products and services, and result in
harm to the Company's reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and
services, lost sales, and lower profit margins.

####### The Company's business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding the collection, use, protection and transfer of personal data.

The Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention,
protection and transfer of various types of personal data. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but
also restrict transfers of personal data among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed
laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending.
These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing
requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to
change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.

The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal data through its privacy policy, information provided on
its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure or perceived failure by the Company
to comply with these public statements or with federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could
result in inquiries, proceedings and penalties from governmental entities or others. Such a failure or perceived failure could also
result in reputational impacts, ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. The risks of inadvertent disclosure of
personal data can increase with the introduction of new and complex technologies, such as artificial intelligence features, further
exacerbating such risks.

In addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, protection and transfer of personal data, the Company is
also subject to specific obligations relating to the collection and processing of data associated with minors, as well as information
considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health, biometric, financial and payment card data. Health, biometric,
financial and payment card data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the
Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company's compliance with these obligations. If the
Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, the Company can be subject to litigation or government
investigations, can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can incur significant fees or fines.

The Company is also subject to new and changing laws and regulations regarding online safety, including enhanced protections
for minors and mandatory age verification requirements. These laws and regulations can increase regulatory risks by requiring
complex compliance measures and significant modifications to the Company's products, services and operations, and may lead
to operational disruptions, heightened privacy and data security risks, increased costs and potential liability and fines, all of which
can have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.


#### Financial Risks


##### The Company's net sales and gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors.

The Company's gross margins vary significantly across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels
and can change over time. The Company's net sales and gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a
variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the
Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company's ability to effectively stimulate demand
for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of
components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company's services; the
Company's ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the
geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product
and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; the imposition of new
or increased tariffs and other trade restrictions, their overall magnitude and duration, and retaliatory actions in response; and the
introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with lower profit margins. These and other factors
could have a materially adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Further, the
Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product category and a decline in demand for that product
could significantly impact net sales and gross margins.


##### The Company's financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.

The Company's primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales, cost
of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company's products in foreign countries and on products that
include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be
materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.

The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign
currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing
demand for the Company's products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to
raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar's strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross
margins the Company earns on foreign currency-denominated sales.

<!-- PageFooter="Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 15" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company's foreign
currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its
foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may
increase the Company's cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.

The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a
portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are
in place.


##### The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.

The Company's investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and
economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of
the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Although the Company has not
realized significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in
significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition and stock
price.


##### The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.

The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers and other resellers.
The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and
government customers. A substantial majority of the Company's outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral,
third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company's trade
receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company's exposure to credit and
collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-
trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture
subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with
long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 27, 2025, the Company's vendor non-
trade receivables were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. If the Company is unable to
monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, the
Company's results of operations, financial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.


##### The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.

The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a
number of the Company's subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income
taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the
introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company's effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings
in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of
new taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant
judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.

The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service
and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome
resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. The outcome of such examinations is
inherently uncertain. If the Company's effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company's
taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company's business, results of operations, financial
condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.

<!-- PageFooter="Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 16" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->


#### General Risks


##### The price of the Company's stock is subject to volatility.

The Company's stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally,
the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price
and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies' operating
performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to
exceed the stock's price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future
growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will
continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are
subject to declaration by the Company's Board of Directors ("Board"), and the Company's share repurchase program does not
obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth,
profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company's stock may decline
significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.


### Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

None.


### Item 1C. Cybersecurity

The Company's management, led by its Head of Corporate Information Security, has overall responsibility for identifying,
assessing and managing any material risks from cybersecurity threats. The Company's Head of Corporate Information Security
leads a dedicated Information Security team of highly skilled individuals with experience across industries that, among other
things, develops and distributes information security policies, standards and procedures; engages in employee cybersecurity
training; implements security controls; assesses security risk and compliance posture; monitors and responds to security events;
and executes security testing and assessments. The Company's Head of Corporate Information Security has extensive
knowledge and skills gained from over 25 years of experience in the cybersecurity industry, including serving in leadership
positions at other large technology companies and leading the Company's Information Security team since 2016.

The Company's Information Security team coordinates with teams across the Company to prevent, respond to and manage
security incidents, and engages third parties, as appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of its security
processes and incident response. A dedicated Supplier Trust team manages information security risks the Company is exposed
to through its supplier relationships. The Company has processes to log, track, address, and escalate for further assessment and
report, as appropriate, cybersecurity incidents across the Company and its suppliers to senior management and the Audit and
Finance Committee ("Audit Committee") of the Board. The Company's enterprise risk management program is designed to
identify, assess, and monitor the Company's business risks, including financial, operational, compliance and reputational risks,
and reflects management's assessment of cybersecurity risks.

The Audit Committee assists the Board in the oversight and monitoring of cybersecurity matters. The Audit Committee regularly
reviews and discusses the Company's cybersecurity risks with management, including the Company's Head of Corporate
Information Security, its General Counsel and the Heads of Compliance and Business Conduct, Business Assurance, and
Internal Audit, and receives updates, as necessary, regarding cybersecurity incidents. The Chair of the Audit Committee
regularly reports the substance of such reviews and discussions to the Board, as necessary, and recommends to the Board such
actions as the Audit Committee deems appropriate.

For a discussion of the Company's cybersecurity-related risks, see Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading "Risk Factors."


### Item 2. Properties

The Company's headquarters is located in Cupertino, California. As of September 27, 2025, the Company owned or leased
facilities and land for corporate functions, R&D, data centers, retail and other purposes at locations throughout the U.S. and in
various places outside the U.S. The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment, which are used by all reportable
segments, are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business.

<!-- PageFooter="Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 17" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->


### Item 3. Legal Proceedings


#### Digital Markets Act Investigations

On March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened a formal noncompliance investigation against the Company
under Article 5(4) of the EU DMA ("Article 5(4) Investigation"). The Article 5(4) Investigation relates to how developers may
communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store, as well as how developers may
conclude contracts with those end users. On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened an additional formal
investigation against the Company regarding whether the Company's new contractual requirements for third-party app
developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA ("Article 6(4) Investigation"). On April 23, 2025, the Commission fined the
Company €500 million in the Article 5(4) Investigation and issued a cease and desist order requiring the Company to remove
technical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to alternative distribution channels outside the
App Store. The Company has appealed the Commission's Article 5(4) decision. Also on April 23, 2025, the Commission issued
preliminary findings in the Article 6(4) Investigation. If the Commission makes a final determination in the Article 6(4)
Investigation that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the
Company's annual worldwide net sales. The Commission may also seek to impose additional fines if it deems that the Company
has violated a cease and desist order. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes
to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.


#### Department of Justice Lawsuit

On March 21, 2024, the DOJ and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District
Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for
"performance smartphones" and "smartphones" in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress
the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the
U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The
Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.


#### Epic Games

Epic Games, Inc. filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ("California District Court") against
the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California's unfair competition law based upon the
Company's operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company's App Review
Guidelines violate California's unfair competition law and issued an injunction (the "2021 Injunction") enjoining the Company from
prohibiting developers from including in their apps buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to
purchasing mechanisms other than the Company's in-app purchase system. The 2021 Injunction applies to apps on the U.S.
storefronts of the iOS and iPadOS App Stores. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the 2021
Injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a
motion with the California District Court to narrow or vacate the 2021 Injunction. On April 30, 2025, the California District Court
found the Company to be in violation of the 2021 Injunction and enjoined the Company from imposing any commission or any fee
on purchases that consumers make outside an app; restricting, conditioning, limiting, or prohibiting how developers guide
consumers to purchases outside an app; or otherwise interfering with a consumer's choice to proceed in or out of an app. The
California District Court also denied the Company's motion to narrow or vacate the 2021 Injunction and referred the Company to
the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California for a determination whether criminal contempt proceedings are
appropriate. The Company will continue to vigorously defend its actions and employees, and has appealed the California District
Court's most recent decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ("Ninth Circuit Court"). Although the Company's
request to stay the decision pending appeal was denied, the Ninth Circuit Court has agreed to consider the Company's appeal
on an expedited basis, with oral arguments heard in October 2025.


#### Other Legal Proceedings

The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the
ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2025 that did not individually or in
the aggregate have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is
inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above
management's expectations, the Company's financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially
adversely affected.

### Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes
included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2025 and 2024 items and year-to-year comparisons
between 2025 and 2024. Discussions of 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023 are not included,
and can be found in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item
7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024.


#### Product, Service and Software Announcements

. Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3 and Apple Watch Ultra 3

· AirPods Pro 3


##### Fiscal Period

The Company's fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is
included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company's fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which
occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company's fiscal years 2025 and 2024 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year
2023 spanned 53 weeks.


##### Macroeconomic Conditions

Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and
could in the future materially impact, the Company's results of operations and financial condition.

<!-- PageFooter="Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 21" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->


##### Tariffs and Other Measures

Beginning in the second quarter of 2025, new U.S. Tariffs were announced, including additional tariffs on imports from China,
India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the EU, among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or
threatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S.
Tariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs
or other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the
Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing
equipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other
measures that are applied to the Company's products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the
Company's business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company's supply chain, the
availability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains
uncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are
announced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the
overall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the
overall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment
for the Company's products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company's business and results of
operations.

services.

Services gross margin percentage increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to a different mix of services, partially
offset by higher costs.

The Company's future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K
under the heading "Risk Factors." As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and
downward pressure.

#### Provision for Income Taxes

Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2025, 2024 and 2023 were as follows
(dollars in millions):


<table>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>2025</th>
<th>2024</th>
<th>2023</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Provision for income taxes</td>
<td>$ 20,719</td>
<td>$ 29,749</td>
<td>$ 16,741</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Effective tax rate</td>
<td>15.6%</td>
<td>24.1%</td>
<td>14.7%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Statutory federal income tax rate</td>
<td>21%</td>
<td>21%</td>
<td>21%</td>
</tr>
</table>


The Company's effective tax rate for 2025 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to a lower effective
tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits, the impact of the U.S. federal R&D
credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by a change in valuation allowance and state income
taxes.

The Company's effective tax rate for 2025 was lower compared to 2024 due to a $10.7 billion year-over-year decrease in the
provision for income taxes related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 7, "Income Taxes" in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) and the impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset
by a change in valuation allowance and a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings.


#### Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which totaled $132.4 billion as of
September 27, 2025, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient
to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.

The Company's material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations:


##### Debt

As of September 27, 2025, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal
amount of $91.3 billion (collectively the "Notes"), with $12.4 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments
associated with the Notes total $37.0 billion, with $2.6 billion payable within 12 months.

The Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of
September 27, 2025, the Company had $8.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, which was payable within 12 months.


##### Leases

The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and
retail space. As of September 27, 2025, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $16.8 billion, with $2.6 billion
payable within 12 months.


##### Manufacturing Purchase Obligations

The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company's products and to perform
final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide
variety of individual suppliers. As of September 27, 2025, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $56.2 billion,
with $55.4 billion payable within 12 months.


##### Other Purchase Obligations

The Company's other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including
assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual
property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 27, 2025, the Company had other purchase obligations of $14.8
billion, with $7.0 billion payable within 12 months.


##### Deemed Repatriation Tax Payable

As of September 27, 2025, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of
2017 ("TCJA") was $8.8 billion, which was payable within 12 months.

<!-- PageFooter="Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 25" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->


##### Capital Return Program

In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does
not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 27, 2025, the Company's quarterly cash
dividend was $0.26 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the
Board.

In May 2025, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $100 billion and raised its quarterly dividend
from $0.25 to $0.26 per share beginning in May 2025. During 2025, the Company repurchased $89.3 billion of its common stock
and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.4 billion.


#### Recent Accounting Pronouncements


##### Internal-Use Software

In September 2025, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No.
2025-06, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Targeted Improvements to the
Accounting for Internal-Use Software ("ASU 2025-06"), which modernizes the accounting for internal-use software. ASU
2025-06 removes all references to software development stages and requires capitalization of software costs when management
has committed to the software project and it is probable the software will be completed and perform its intended use. ASU
2025-06 will be effective for the Company in its first quarter of 2029, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently
evaluating the timing and method of its adoption of ASU 2025-06.


##### Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense
Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses ("ASU 2024-03") and in January
2025, the FASB issued ASU No. 2025-01, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation
Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Clarifying the Effective Date, which clarified the effective date of ASU 2024-03. ASU 2024-03 will
require the Company to disclose the amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible
asset amortization, as applicable, included in certain expense captions in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, as well as
qualitatively describe remaining amounts included in those captions. ASU 2024-03 will also require the Company to disclose both
the amount and the Company's definition of selling expenses. The Company will adopt ASU 2024-03 in its fourth quarter of 2028
using a prospective transition method.


##### Income Taxes

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
("ASU 2023-09"), which will require the Company to disclose specified additional information in its income tax rate reconciliation
and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 will also require the
Company to disaggregate its income taxes paid disclosure by federal, state and foreign taxes, with further disaggregation
required for significant individual jurisdictions. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-09 in its fourth quarter of 2026 using a
prospective transition method.


#### Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP") and the Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company's
management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, "Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the
significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under
the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.


##### Uncertain Tax Positions

The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company's
uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and
international tax laws, including the TCJA and the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although
management believes the Company's reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these
uncertainties will not be different from that reflected in the Company's reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing
facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent
with management's expectations could have a material impact on the Company's financial condition and operating results.

<!-- PageFooter="Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 26" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->


##### Legal and Other Contingencies

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of
which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount is
reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner
inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on the Company's financial condition and operating
results.


### Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies
to manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company's consolidated financial statements.


#### Interest Rate Risk

The Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company's investment portfolio
and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company's investment portfolio and increase
the interest expense on the Company's term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative
instruments, offset interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.

The following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company's investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any
associated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September 27, 2025 and
September 28, 2024 (dollars in millions):


<table>
<tr>
<th>Interest Rate Sensitive Instrument</th>
<th>Hypothetical Interest Rate Increase</th>
<th>Potential Impact</th>
<th>2025</th>
<th>2024</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Investment portfolio</td>
<td>100 basis points, all tenors</td>
<td>Decline in fair value</td>
<td>$ 2,416</td>
<td>$ 2,755</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Term debt</td>
<td>100 basis points, all tenors</td>
<td>Increase in annual interest expense</td>
<td>$ 129</td>
<td>$ 139</td>
</tr>
</table>


#### Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

The Company's exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other
than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the
Company's net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair
values of certain of the Company's assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use
derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company
may choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or
prohibitive cost.

The Company applied a value-at-risk ("VAR") model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of
fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair
value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company's foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates.
Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $590
million and $538 million as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, respectively. Changes in the Company's underlying
foreign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the
Company's foreign currency derivatives.

# Apple Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements


## Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies


### Basis of Presentation and Preparation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The preparation of
these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP requires the use of management
estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the notes to consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to
the current period's presentation.

The Company's fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is
included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company's fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which
occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company's fiscal years 2025 and 2024 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal
year 2023 spanned 53 weeks. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the
Company's fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.


### Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements


#### Segment Reporting

Beginning with the 2025 annual reporting period, the Company adopted the FASB's ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting
(Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ("ASU 2023-07"), which requires the Company to disclose
segment expenses that are significant and regularly provided to the Company's chief operating decision maker ("CODM"). In
addition, ASU 2023-07 requires the Company to disclose the title and position of its CODM and how the CODM uses segment
profit or loss information in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The Company adopted
ASU 2023-07 using a retrospective transition method.


### Revenue

The Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities.


### Share-Based Compensation

The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will
ultimately vest.


### Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are treated as cash equivalents.


### Trade Receivables

Trade receivables are stated at transaction price.


### Marketable Securities

The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.


### Inventories

Inventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.


### Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line
basis.

<!-- PageFooter="Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 34" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->


### Derivative Instruments

The Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.


### Income Taxes

The Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings
created by the TCJA.


### Leases

The Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of corporate
and retail facilities.


### Note 2 - Revenue

The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of products or services is
transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the
significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company's
Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company's Services net sales, control transfers over
time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer
of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.

The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer
incentive programs based on the Company's expectations and historical experience.

For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the
Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices ("SSPs").
When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are
established that reflect the Company's best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they
were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company's process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers
multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation
including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings,
product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.

The Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac
and iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the
hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive
certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any
related discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable
prices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company's estimated SSPs. Revenue
allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which
generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized
on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.

For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For
these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that
any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized
revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.

For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the
Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when
determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product,
retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party
applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the
customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application-related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services
net sales only the commission it retains.

The following table shows disaggregated net sales, as well as the portion of total net sales that was previously deferred, for
2025, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):

</tr>
</table>

(1) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.


The Company's proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment
in Note 13, "Segment Information and Geographic Data" for 2025, 2024 and 2023, except in Greater China, where iPhone
revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.

As of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the Company had total deferred revenue of $13.7 billion and $12.8 billion,
respectively. As of September 27, 2025, the Company expects 66% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year,
23% within one-to-two years, 9% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than three years.

</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
</table>


Approximately 24 million restricted stock units ("RSUs") were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for
2023 because their effect would have been antidilutive.

(1) The valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of the Company's Level 2 financial instruments, which generally
have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant
inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.

(2) As of September 28, 2024, cash and cash equivalents included $2.6 billion held in escrow and restricted from general use.
These restricted cash and cash equivalents were designated to settle the Company's obligation related to the State Aid
Decision (refer to Note 7, "Income Taxes").

(3) As of September 28, 2024, current marketable securities included $13.2 billion held in escrow and restricted from general
use. These restricted marketable securities were designated to settle the Company's obligation related to the State Aid
Decision (refer to Note 7, "Income Taxes").


<!-- PageFooter="Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 37" -->

As of September 27, 2025, 80% of the Company's non-current marketable debt securities other than mortgage- and asset-
backed securities had maturities between 1 and 5 years, 15% between 5 and 10 years, and 5% greater than 10 years. As of
September 27, 2025, 13% of the Company's non-current mortgage- and asset-backed securities had maturities between 1 and 5
years, 14% between 5 and 10 years, and 73% greater than 10 years.

The Company's investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The
Company classifies marketable debt securities as either current or non-current based on each instrument's underlying maturity.


#### Derivative Instruments and Hedging

The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations
or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a
portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.

All derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting treatment for derivative
gains and losses is based on intended use and hedge designation.

Gains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of cash flow hedge effectiveness are initially deferred
in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction
affects earnings, and in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Gains and losses arising from amounts
that are included in the assessment of fair value hedge effectiveness are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations line item to which the hedge relates along with offsetting losses and gains related to the change in value of the
hedged item.

For derivative instruments designated as cash flow and fair value hedges, amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness are recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line
item to which the hedge relates. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are
recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss).

Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges
are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows as the items being hedged, which are generally classified as operating activities.


##### Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other
instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its
forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.

To protect the Company's foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign
exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these
instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 27, 2025, the maximum length of time over which the
Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt-related foreign currency transactions is 17
years.

The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from
certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by
the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.


##### Interest Rate Risk

To protect the Company's term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest
rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.

#### Accounts Receivable


##### Trade Receivables

As of September 27, 2025, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which
accounted for 12%. The Company's third-party cellular network carriers accounted for 34% and 38% of total trade receivables as
of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, respectively. The Company requires third-party credit support or collateral from
certain customers to limit credit risk.


##### Vendor Non-Trade Receivables

The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to
these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these
components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather,
the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related final products are
sold by the Company. As of September 27, 2025, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of
total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 46% and 23%. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had two
vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 44% and 23%.

## Note 7 - Income Taxes


### European Commission State Aid Decision

On August 30, 2016, the Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax
opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company
("State Aid Decision"). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the
period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of
the tax opinions from that date forward.

The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union
("General Court"). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the
Commission appealed the General Court's decision to the European Court of Justice ("ECJ"). On September 10, 2024, the ECJ
announced that it had set aside the 2020 judgment of the General Court and confirmed the Commission's 2016 State Aid
Decision. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2024 the Company recorded a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion, net,
which represented $15.8 billion payable to Ireland via release of amounts held in escrow, partially offset by a U.S. foreign tax
credit of $4.8 billion and a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of $823 million.

### Uncertain Tax Positions

As of September 27, 2025, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $23.2 billion, of which $10.6 billion, if
recognized, would impact the Company's effective tax rate. As of September 28, 2024, the total amount of gross unrecognized
tax benefits was $22.0 billion, of which $10.8 billion, if recognized, would have impacted the Company's effective tax rate.

The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign
jurisdictions. Tax years 2018 and after 2021 for the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain major foreign jurisdictions,
remain subject to examination. Although the timing of resolution or closure of examinations is not certain, the Company believes
it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease as much as $6 billion in the next 12 months.


## Note 8 - Leases

The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and
retail space. These leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multiyear renewal options,
some of which are reasonably certain of exercise.

Payments under the Company's lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based
on purchases of output of the underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the Company's operating
leases were $2.1 billion for 2025 and $2.0 billion for both 2024 and 2023. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the
Company's leases were $16.1 billion, $13.8 billion and $13.9 billion for 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The Company made fixed cash payments related to operating leases of $2.1 billion in 2025 and $1.9 billion in both 2024 and
2023. Noncash activities involving right-of-use ("ROU") assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $2.8 billion, $1.0
billion and $2.1 billion for 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The weighted-average remaining lease term related to the Company's lease liabilities as of September 27, 2025 and
September 28, 2024 was 9.8 years and 10.3 years, respectively. The discount rate related to the Company's lease liabilities as
of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024 was 3.4% and 3.1%, respectively. The discount rates related to the Company's
lease liabilities are generally based on estimates of the Company's incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in
the Company's leases cannot be readily determined.

As of September 27, 2025, the Company had $523 million of fixed payment obligations under additional leases, primarily for
corporate facilities and retail space, that had not yet commenced. These leases are expected to commence between 2026 and
2027, with lease terms ranging from 1 year to 21 years.

To manage interest rate risk on certain of its U.S. dollar-denominated fixed-rate notes, the Company uses interest rate swaps to
effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates on a portion of these notes. Additionally, to manage foreign
exchange rate risk on certain of its foreign currency-denominated notes, the Company uses cross-currency swaps to effectively
convert these notes to U.S. dollar-denominated notes.

The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount or premium and, if
applicable, adjustments related to hedging.

The future principal payments for the Company's Notes as of September 27, 2025, are as follows (in millions):

## Note 11 - Share-Based Compensation


### 2022 Employee Stock Plan

The Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan ("2022 Plan") is a shareholder-approved plan that provides for broad-based equity
grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of RSUs, stock grants, performance-based awards,
stock options and stock appreciation rights. RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan generally vest over four years, based on
continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company's common stock on a one-for-one basis. All
RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan have dividend equivalent rights, which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value
per share as holders of common stock. A maximum of approximately 1.3 billion shares were authorized for issuance pursuant to
2022 Plan awards at the time the plan was approved on March 4, 2022.


### Restricted Stock Units

A summary of the Company's RSU activity and related information for 2025 is as follows:


<table>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Number of RSUS (in thousands)</th>
<th>Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value Per RSU</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Balance as of September 28, 2024</td>
<td>163,326</td>
<td>$ 158.73</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RSUs granted</td>
<td>73,466</td>
<td>$ 226.68</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RSUs vested</td>
<td>(76,845)</td>
<td>$ 159.85</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RSUs forfeited</td>
<td>(8,373)</td>
<td>$ 183.03</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Balance as of September 27, 2025</td>
<td>151,574</td>
<td>$ 189.75</td>
</tr>
</table>


The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted in 2024 and 2023 was $173.78 and $150.87, respectively. The
Company estimates the grant-date fair value of RSUs based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of
grant.

The total vesting-date fair value of RSUs was $17.1 billion, $15.8 billion and $15.9 billion for 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The majority of RSUs that vested in 2025, 2024 and 2023 were net share settled such that the Company withheld shares with a
value equivalent to the employees' obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted cash to the
appropriate taxing authorities. Total payments to taxing authorities for employees' tax obligations were $6.1 billion in 2025 and
$5.6 billion in both 2024 and 2023.


### Share-Based Compensation

## Note 12 - Commitments, Contingencies and Supply Concentrations


### Unconditional Purchase Obligations

The Company has entered into certain off-balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services
("unconditional purchase obligations"). The Company's unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of supplier
arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. Future payments under unconditional purchase
obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 27, 2025, are as follows (in millions):


<table>
<tr>
<td>2026</td>
<td>$ 4,752</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2027</td>
<td>3,708</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2028</td>
<td>1,981</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2029</td>
<td>1,306</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2030</td>
<td>788</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Thereafter</td>
<td>773</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Total</td>
<td>$ 13,308</td>
</tr>
</table>


### Contingencies

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that
have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at
least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual,
concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.


### Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product

Although most components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, certain
components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with
other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many
components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide
shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. Restrictions on international trade can increase the cost or limit the
availability of the Company's products and the components and rare earths and other raw materials that go into them.

The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by
the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new
technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers' yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have
increased. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, the Company may not be
able to extend or renew agreements for the supply of components on similar terms, or at all, and may not be successful in
obtaining sufficient quantities from its suppliers or in a timely manner, or in identifying and obtaining sufficient quantities from an
alternative source. In addition, component suppliers may fail, be subject to consolidation within a particular industry, or decide to
concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements,
further limiting the Company's ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.

Substantially all of the Company's hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in
China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.

<!-- PageFooter="Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 46" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->


## Note 13 - Segment Information and Geographic Data

The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's CEO is its CODM.

The Company's reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas
includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa.
Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia, New Zealand and those
Asian countries not included in the Company's other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar
hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the
Company's customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.

The CODM uses segment net sales and operating income information to make certain decisions, such as product and service
pricing, and to decide how to allocate resources related to sales activities and marketing investments. Net sales for geographic
segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company's retail stores located in those
geographic locations. Operating income for each segment consists of net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and
operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. The information provided to the CODM for purposes of making decisions
and assessing segment performance excludes asset information.

# Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


## To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.


### Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. (the "Company") as of September 27, 2025 and
September 28, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 27, 2025, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the
"financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company at September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended September 27, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
("PCAOB"), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2025, based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(2013 framework) and our report dated October 31, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.


### Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are
required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to
error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included
evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


### Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are
material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The
communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole,
and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on
the account or disclosure to which it relates.

<th>Uncertain Tax Positions</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Description of the Matter</td>
<td>As discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, the Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. As of September 27, 2025, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $23.2 billion, of which $10.6 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company's effective tax rate. In accounting for some of the uncertain tax positions, the Company uses significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws.</td>

# How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls
over management's assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be
sustained, management's process to measure the benefit of its tax positions that qualify for
recognition, and the related disclosures.

We evaluated the Company's assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to
be sustained and the related measurement of the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for
recognition. Our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating
management's assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, the Company's
communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the
uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the
technical merits of certain of the Company's tax positions based on our knowledge of
relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing authorities. In addition, we evaluated
the Company's disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 7 to the financial
statements.

/s/ Ernst & Young LLP

We have served as the Company's auditor since 2009.

# Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


## To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.


### Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Apple Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2025, based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(2013 framework) (the "COSO criteria"). In our opinion, Apple Inc. (the "Company") maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2025, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
("PCAOB"), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the related
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended September 27, 2025, and the related notes and our report dated October 31, 2025 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.


### Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Annual
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be
independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.


### Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.


# Item 9A. Controls and Procedures


## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, the Company's principal
executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September 27, 2025 to provide reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
(i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and
(ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.


## Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls

The Company's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company's
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

(i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the Company's assets;

(ii)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company's receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of the Company's management and directors; and

(iii)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company's
internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a
control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative
to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of
controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in
business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


## Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company's
assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 27, 2025
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit
report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.


## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2025, which were
identified in connection with management's evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the
Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over
financial reporting.

# DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT'S SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

As of September 27, 2025, Apple Inc. ("Apple" or the "Company") had eight classes of securities registered
under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"): (i) Common Stock,
$0.00001 par value per share ("Common Stock"); (ii) 0.000% Notes due 2025 (the "2025 Notes"); (iii) 1.625% Notes
due 2026 (the "2026 Notes"); (iv) 2.000% Notes due 2027 (the "2027 Notes"); (v) 1.375% Notes due 2029 (the
"1.375% 2029 Notes"); (vi) 3.050% Notes due 2029 (the "3.050% 2029 Notes"); (vii) 0.500% Notes due 2031 (the
"2031 Notes"); and (viii) 3.600% Notes due 2042 (the "2042 Notes," and together with the 2025 Notes, the 2026
Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 1.375% 2029 Notes, the 3.050% 2029 Notes, and the 2031 Notes, the "Notes"). Each of
the Company's securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act are listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market
LLC.


## DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK

The following is a description of the rights of Common Stock and related provisions of the Company's
Restated Articles of Incorporation (the "Articles") and Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Bylaws") and applicable
California law. This description is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the Articles,
Bylaws and applicable California law.


### Authorized Capital Stock

The Company's authorized capital stock consists of 50,400,000,000 shares of Common Stock.


### Common Stock


#### Fully Paid and Nonassessable

All of the outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock are fully paid and nonassessable.


#### Voting Rights

The holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted on by
such holders. Holders of shares of Common Stock are not entitled to cumulative voting rights.

Except as described below or as required by law, all matters to be voted on by shareholders must be
approved by the affirmative vote of (i) a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting and (ii) a
majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.

In an election of directors where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the
candidates receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares entitled to be voted for them up to the
number of directors to be elected by such shares will be elected.

The Company's entire Board of Directors or any individual director may be removed without cause by an
affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, subject to the provisions of the Company's
Bylaws.

Vacancies created by the removal of a director must be filled only by approval of the shareholders, or by the
unanimous written consent of all shares entitled to vote. The shareholders may elect a director at any time to fill a
vacancy not filled by the directors, but any such election by written consent, other than to fill a vacancy created by
removal, requires the consent of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon.

An amendment of the Bylaws or the Articles may be adopted by the vote of the majority of the outstanding
shares entitled to vote. Any amendment of the Bylaws specifying or changing a fixed number of directors or the
maximum or minimum number or changing from a fixed to a variable board or vice versa may only be adopted by the
shareholders; provided, however, that an amendment of the Bylaws or the Articles reducing the fixed number or the
minimum number of directors to less than five cannot be adopted if the votes cast against its adoption are equal to
more than 16 2/3% of the outstanding shares entitled to vote.

<!-- PageBreak -->

Any shareholders' meeting may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of the shares
present in person or represented by proxy.


### Dividends

The holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividends, if any, as may be declared
from time to time by the Company's Board of Directors in its discretion from funds legally available therefor.


### Right to Receive Liquidation Distributions

Upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, the holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive
pro rata all assets remaining available for distribution to holders of such shares.


### No Preemptive or Similar Rights

Common Stock has no preemptive or other subscription rights, and there are no conversion rights or
redemption or sinking fund provisions with respect to such shares of Common Stock.


### Anti-Takeover Provisions of the Articles, Bylaws and California Law

Provisions of the Articles and Bylaws may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential
change in control of the Company or change in its management, including transactions in which shareholders might
otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that its shareholders might otherwise deem to be in their
best interests. Among other things, the Articles and Bylaws:

· provide that, except for a vacancy caused by the removal of a director as provided in the Bylaws, a
vacancy on the Company's Board of Directors may be filled by a person selected by a majority of the
remaining directors then in office, whether or not less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director;

· provide that shareholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of shareholders or to nominate
candidates for election as directors at a meeting of shareholders must provide notice in writing in a
timely manner, and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a shareholder's notice,
including with respect to a shareholder's notice under Rule 14a-19 of the Exchange Act;

· provide that a shareholder, or group of up to 20 shareholders, that has owned continuously for at least
three years shares of Common Stock representing an aggregate of at least 3% of the Company's
outstanding shares of Common Stock, may nominate and include in the Company's proxy materials
director nominees constituting up to 20% of the Company's Board of Directors, provided that the
shareholder(s) and nominee(s) satisfy the requirements in the Bylaws;

· do not provide for cumulative voting rights for the election of directors; and

· provide that special meetings of the shareholders may only be called by (i) the Board of Directors, the
Chair of the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer or (ii) one or more holders of shares
entitled to cast not less than ten percent (10%) of the votes on the record date established pursuant to
the Company's Bylaws, provided that the shareholder(s) satisfy requirements in the Bylaws.

In addition, as a California corporation, the Company is subject to the provisions of Section 1203 of the
California General Corporation Law, which requires it to provide a fairness opinion to its shareholders in connection
with their consideration of any proposed "interested party" reorganization transaction.

Listing

The Company's Common Stock is listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the trading symbol
"AAPL."

## DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES

The following description of the Notes is a summary and does not purport to be complete. This description is
qualified in its entirety by reference, as applicable, to the Indenture, dated as of April 29, 2013, between Apple Inc.
and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "2013 Indenture") and the Indenture, dated
as of November 5, 2018, between Apple Inc. and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the
"2018 Indenture," and together with the 2013 Indenture, the "Indentures"). References in this section to the
"Company," "us," "we" and "our" are solely to Apple Inc. and not to any of its subsidiaries, unless the context requires
otherwise.


### The Notes

Each of the Notes were issued under the applicable Indenture, which provides that debt securities may be
issued under such Indenture from time to time in one or more series. The Indentures and the Notes are governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. The Indentures do not limit the amount of debt
securities that we may issue thereunder. We may, without the consent of the holders of the debt securities of any
series, issue additional debt securities ranking equally with, and otherwise similar in all respects to, the debt securities
of the series (except for the date of issuance, the date interest begins to accrue and, in certain circumstances, the
first interest payment date) so that those additional debt securities will be consolidated and form a single series with
the debt securities of the series previously offered and sold; provided, however, that any additional debt securities will
have a separate ISIN number unless certain conditions are met.

£500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2042 Notes was outstanding.


### Ranking

The Notes are our senior unsecured indebtedness and rank equally with each other and with all of our other
senior unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding. However, the Notes are
structurally subordinated to any indebtedness and preferred stock, if any, of our subsidiaries and are effectively
subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.
Claims of the creditors of our subsidiaries generally have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such
subsidiaries over the claims of our creditors, including holders of the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes are effectively
subordinated to creditors, including trade creditors and preferred stockholders, if any, of our subsidiaries. The
Indentures do not restrict our ability or that of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness.


### Payment on the Notes

All payments of principal of, the redemption price (if any), and interest and additional amounts (if any) on the
2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 1.375% 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes are payable in euro,
provided that, if the euro is unavailable to the Company due to the imposition of exchange controls or other
circumstances beyond the Company's control, or if the euro is no longer being used by the then member states of the
European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public
institutions of or within the international banking community, then all payments in respect of the 2025 Notes, the 2026
Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 1.375% 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes will be made in U.S. dollars, until the euro is
again available to the Company or so used. The amount payable on any date in euro will be converted into U.S.
dollars at the rate mandated by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board as of the close of business on the second Business
Day prior to the relevant payment date or, in the event the U.S. Federal Reserve Board has not mandated a rate of
conversion, on the basis of the most recent U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate published in The Wall Street Journal on or
prior to the second Business Day prior to the relevant payment date. Any payment in respect of the 2025 Notes, the
2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 1.375% 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes so made in U.S. dollars will not constitute
an event of default under such Notes or the applicable Indenture.

With respect to the 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 1.375% 2029 Notes and the 2031
Notes, "Business Day" means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, (1) which is not a day on which banking
institutions in The City of New York or London are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to
close and (2) on which the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross Settlement Express Transfer system (the
TARGET2 system), or any successor thereto, is open.

All payments of principal of, the redemption price (if any), and interest and additional amounts (if any) on the
3.050% 2029 Notes and the 2042 Notes are payable in pounds sterling, or, if the United Kingdom adopts euro as its
lawful currency, in euro. If pounds sterling or, in the event the Notes are redenominated into euro, euro is unavailable
to the Company due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the Company's control or,
in the event the notes are redenominated into euro, the euro is no longer being used by the then member states of
the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by
public institutions of or within the international banking community, then all payments in respect of the 3.050% 2029
Notes and the 2042 Notes will be made in U.S. dollars until the pound sterling or euro, as the case may be, is again
available to the Company or so used. The amount payable on any date in pounds sterling or, in the event such Notes
are redenominated into euro, euro will be converted into U.S. dollars at the rate mandated by the U.S. Federal
Reserve Board as of the close of business on the second Business Day prior to the relevant payment date or, in the
event the U.S. Federal Reserve Board has not mandated a rate of conversion, on the basis of the most recent U.S.
dollar/pounds sterling or, in the event the Notes are redenominated into euro, the most recent U.S. dollar/euro

<!-- PageNumber="4" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

exchange rate published in The Wall Street Journal on or prior to the second Business Day prior to the relevant
payment date. Any payment in respect of the 3.050% 2029 Notes and the 2042 Notes so made in U.S. dollars will not
constitute an event of default under such Notes or the 2013 Indenture.

With respect to the 3.050% 2029 Notes and the 2042 Notes, "Business Day" means any day which is not a
day on which banking institutions in The City of New York or London or the relevant place of payment are authorized
or required by law, regulation or executive order to close.


### Payment of Additional Amounts

The terms of the Notes state that all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Notes will be made
free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties,
assessments or other governmental charges of whatsoever nature required to be deducted or withheld by the United
States or any political subdivision or taxing authority of or in the United States, unless such withholding or deduction
is required by law.

All of the Notes also contain a covenant substantially similar to the following:

The Company will, subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth below, pay as additional interest on the
Notes such additional amounts ("Additional Amounts") as are necessary in order that the net payment by the
Company or the paying agent of the Company for the applicable Notes ("Paying Agent") of the principal of and
interest on the Notes to a holder who is not a United States person (as defined below), after withholding or deduction
for any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge ("Tax") imposed by the United States or a
taxing authority in the United States, will not be less than the amount provided in the Notes to be then due and
payable; provided, however, that the foregoing obligation to pay Additional Amounts shall not apply:

(1) to any Tax that is imposed by reason of the holder (or the beneficial owner for whose benefit such
holder holds the Notes), or a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of the holder if the
holder is an estate, trust, partnership or corporation, or a person holding a power over an estate or trust
administered by a fiduciary holder, being considered as:

(a) being or having been engaged in a trade or business in the United States or having or having had a
permanent establishment in the United States;

(b) having a current or former connection with the United States (other than a connection arising solely
as a result of the ownership of the Notes, the receipt of any payment or the enforcement of any
rights hereunder), including being or having been a citizen or resident of the United States;

(c) being or having been a personal holding company, a passive foreign investment company or a
controlled foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or a corporation that has
accumulated earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;

(d) being or having been a "10-percent shareholder" of the Company as defined in Section 871(h)(3) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code");

(e) being a controlled foreign corporation that is related to the Company within the meaning of Section
864(d)(4) of the Code; or

(f) being a bank receiving payments on an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement
entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or business;

(2) to any holder that is not the sole beneficial owner of the Notes, or a portion of the Notes, or that is a
fiduciary, partnership or limited liability company, but only to the extent that a beneficial owner with
respect to the holder, a beneficiary or settlor with respect to the fiduciary, or a beneficial owner or
member of the partnership or limited liability company would not have been entitled to the payment of
an additional amount had the beneficiary, settlor, beneficial owner or member received directly its
beneficial or distributive share of the payment;

<!-- PageNumber="5" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

(3) to any Tax that would not have been imposed but for the failure of the holder or any other person to
comply with certification, identification or information reporting requirements concerning the nationality,
residence, identity or connection with the United States of the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes, if
compliance is required by statute, by regulation of the United States or any taxing authority therein or by
an applicable income tax treaty to which the United States is a party as a precondition to exemption
from such Tax (including, but not limited to, the requirement to provide Internal Revenue Service Forms
W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI, or any subsequent versions thereof or successor thereto, and any
documentation requirement under an applicable income tax treaty);

(4) to any Tax that is imposed otherwise than by withholding by the Company or a Paying Agent from the
payment;

(5) to any Tax that would not have been imposed but for a change in law, regulation, or administrative or
judicial interpretation that becomes effective more than 10 days after the payment becomes due or is
duly provided for, whichever occurs later;

(6) to any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, wealth, capital gains or personal property or
similar Tax;

(7) to any Tax required to be withheld by any paying agent from any payment of principal of or interest on
any Note, if such payment can be made without such withholding by at least one other paying agent;

(8) to any Tax that would not have been imposed but for the presentation by the holder of any Note, where
presentation is required, for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which payment
became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs
later;

(9) to any Tax imposed under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or any amended or successor
provisions), any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any agreement entered
into pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the Code, or any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or practices
adopted pursuant to any intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with the
implementation of such sections of the Code; or

(10) in the case of any combination of items (1) through (9) above.

The Notes are subject in all cases to any tax, fiscal or other law or regulation or administrative or judicial
interpretation applicable to the Notes. Except as specifically provided under this heading "-Payment of Additional
Amounts," the Company will not be required to make any payment for any Tax imposed by any government or a
political subdivision or taxing authority of or in any government or political subdivision. As used under "-Payment of
Additional Amounts" and under "-Redemption for Tax Reasons," the term "United States" means the United States
of America (including the states and the District of Columbia and any political subdivision thereof), and the term
"United States person" means any individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, a corporation, partnership or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the United States,
any state of the United States or the District of Columbia (other than a partnership that is not treated as a United
States person under any applicable Treasury regulations), or any estate or trust the income of which is subject to U.S.
federal income taxation regardless of its source.


#### Redemption for Tax Reasons

If, as a result of any change in, or amendment to, or, in the case of the 2025 Notes and the 2031 Notes,
introduction of, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated under the laws) of the United States (or any
political subdivision or taxing authority of or in the United States), or any change in, or amendments to, an official
position regarding the application or interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, which change or amendment is
announced or becomes effective on or after the date of the applicable prospectus supplement, we become, or based
upon a written opinion of independent counsel selected by us, will become obligated to pay additional amounts as
described above under the heading "Payments of Additional Amounts" with respect to a series of the Notes, then we
may at our option redeem, in whole, but not in part, in the case of the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 3.050% 2029
Notes and the 2042 Notes, the Notes of such series on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice, in the
case of the 1.375% 2029 Notes, the Notes of such series on not less than 15 nor more than 60 days' notice, and in
the case of the 2025 Notes and the 2031 Notes, the Notes of such series on not less than 10 nor more than 60 days'

<!-- PageNumber="6" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

prior notice, in each case at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount, together with interest
accrued but unpaid on those Notes to (and, in the case of the 2025 Notes and the 2031 Notes, but not including) the
date fixed for redemption.


#### Optional Redemption

We may redeem the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 3.050% 2029 Notes and the 2042 Notes at our option,
at any time in whole or from time to time in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of:

· 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed; or

· the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon
(not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption),
discounted to the date of redemption on an annual basis (ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA)) at the applicable
Comparable Government Bond Rate (as defined below), plus 10 basis points in the case of the 2026
Notes, plus 15 basis points in the case of the 3.050% 2029 Notes and the 2042 Notes and plus 20 basis
points in the case of the 2027 Notes.

We may redeem the 2025 Notes, the 1.375% 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes at our option, at any time in
whole or from time to time in part, prior to the applicable Par Call Date at a redemption price equal to the greater of:

· 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed; or

. the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon
assuming that the Notes matured on the applicable Par Call Date (not including any portion of such
payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption), discounted to the date of redemption on an
annual basis (ACTUAL/ACTUAL (ICMA)) at the applicable Comparable Government Bond Rate (as
defined below), plus 10 basis points in the case of the 2025 Notes, plus 15 basis points in the case of
the 2031 Notes, and 20 basis points in the case of the 2029 Notes.

"Par Call Date" means (i) with respect to the 2025 Notes, August 15, 2025 (three months prior to the maturity
date of the 2025 Notes), (ii) with respect to the 1.375% 2029 Notes, February 24, 2029 (three months prior to the
maturity date of 1.375% 2029 Notes) and (iii) with respect to the 2031 Notes, August 15, 2031 (three months prior to
the maturity of the 2031 Notes).

If any of the 2025 Notes, the 1.375% 2029 Notes or the 2031 Notes are redeemed on or after the applicable
Par Call Date, the redemption price for such Notes will equal 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being
redeemed.

In each case upon redemption of the Notes, we will pay accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount
being redeemed to, but excluding, the date of redemption.

Installments of interest on Notes being redeemed that are due and payable on interest payment dates falling
on or prior to a redemption date shall be payable on the interest payment date to the holders as of the close of
business on the relevant regular record date according to the Notes and the applicable Indenture.

"Comparable Government Bond" means, in relation to any Comparable Government Bond Rate calculation
for the 2026 Notes and the 2027 Notes, at the discretion of an independent investment bank selected by us, a
German government bond whose maturity is closest to the maturity of the Notes being redeemed, or if such
independent investment bank in its discretion determines that such similar bond is not in issue, such other German
government bond as such independent investment bank may, with the advice of three brokers of, and/or market
makers in, German government bonds selected by us, determine to be appropriate for determining the Comparable
Government Bond Rate.

"Comparable Government Bond" means, in relation to any Comparable Government Bond Rate calculation
for the 3.050% 2029 Notes and the 2042 Notes, at the discretion of an independent investment bank selected by us,
a United Kingdom government bond whose maturity is closest to the maturity of the Notes being redeemed, or if such
independent investment bank in its discretion determines that such similar bond is not in issue, such other United
Kingdom government bond as such independent investment bank may, with the advice of three brokers of, and/or

<!-- PageNumber="7" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

market makers in, United Kingdom government bonds selected by us, determine to be appropriate for determining the
Comparable Government Bond Rate.

"Comparable Government Bond" means, in relation to any Comparable Government Bond Rate calculation
for the 2025 Notes, the 1.375% 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes, at the discretion of an independent investment bank
selected by us, a German government bond whose maturity is closest to the applicable Par Call Date of the Notes
being redeemed, or if such independent investment bank in its discretion determines that such similar bond is not in
issue, such other German government bond as such independent investment bank may, with the advice of three
brokers of, and/or market makers in, German government bonds selected by us, determine to be appropriate for
determining the Comparable Government Bond Rate.

"Comparable Government Bond Rate" means the price, expressed as a percentage (rounded to three
decimal places, with 0.0005 being rounded upwards), at which the gross redemption yield on the Notes, if they were
to be purchased at such price on the third business day prior to the date fixed for redemption, would be equal to the
gross redemption yield on such business day of the Comparable Government Bond on the basis of the middle market
price of the Comparable Government Bond prevailing at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such business day as
determined by an independent investment bank selected by us.


##### Covenants

The Indentures set forth limited covenants that apply to the Notes. However, these covenants do not, among
other things:

· limit the amount of indebtedness or lease obligations that may be incurred by us and our subsidiaries;

· limit our ability or that of our subsidiaries to issue, assume or guarantee debt secured by liens; or

· restrict us from paying dividends or making distributions on our capital stock or purchasing or redeeming
our capital stock.


###### Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets

The Indentures provide that we may consolidate with or merge with or into any other person, and may sell,
transfer, or lease or convey all or substantially all of our properties and assets to another person; provided that the
following conditions are satisfied:

. we are the continuing entity, or the resulting, surviving or transferee person (the "Successor") is a
person (if such person is not a corporation, then the Successor will include a corporate co-issuer of the
debt securities) organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof
or the District of Columbia and the Successor (if not us) will expressly assume, by supplemental
indenture, all of our obligations under the debt securities and the applicable Indenture and, for each
security that by its terms provides for conversion, provide for the right to convert such security in
accordance with its terms;

· immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no default or event of default under the applicable
Indenture has occurred and is continuing; and

. in the case of the 2013 Indenture, the trustee receives from us an officers' certificate and an opinion of
counsel that the transaction and such supplemental indenture, as the case may be, complies with the
applicable provisions of the 2013 Indenture.

If we consolidate or merge with or into any other person or sell, transfer, lease or convey all or substantially
all of our properties and assets in accordance with the Indentures, the Successor will be substituted for us in the
Indentures, with the same effect as if it had been an original party to the Indentures. As a result, the Successor may
exercise our rights and powers under the Indentures, and we will be released from all our liabilities and obligations
under the Indentures and under the debt securities.

For purposes of this covenant, "person" means any individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, association, joint-stock company, trust, unincorporated organization or government or any
agency or political subdivision thereof or any other entity.

##### Events of Default

Each of the following events are defined in the Indentures as an "event of default" (whatever the reason for
such event of default and whether or not it will be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or
pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or
governmental body) with respect to the debt securities of any series:

(1) default in the payment of any installment of interest on any debt securities of such series for 30 days
after becoming due;

(2) default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, on any debt securities of such series when it
becomes due and payable at its stated maturity, upon optional redemption, upon declaration or
otherwise;

(3) default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or agreement of ours in the applicable Indenture
with respect to the debt securities of such series (other than a covenant or agreement, a default in the
performance of which or a breach of which is elsewhere in the applicable Indenture specifically dealt
with or that has expressly been included in the applicable Indenture solely for the benefit of a series of
debt securities other than such series), which continues for a period of 90 days after written notice to us
by the trustee or to us and the trustee by the holders of, in the case of the 2013 Indenture, at least 25%
in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series, and in the case of the
2018 Indenture, at least 33% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that
series;

(4) we, pursuant to or within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Law:

· commence a voluntary case or proceeding;

· consent to the entry of an order for relief against us in an involuntary case or proceeding;

· consent to the appointment of a custodian of us or for all or substantially all of our property;

· make a general assignment for the benefit of our creditors;

· file a petition in bankruptcy or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief;

· consent to the filing of such petition or the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian; or

· take any comparable action under any foreign laws relating to insolvency;

(5) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under any Bankruptcy Law that:

· is for relief against us in an involuntary case, or adjudicates us insolvent or bankrupt;

· appoints a custodian of us or for all or substantially all of our property; or

· orders the winding-up or liquidation of us (or any similar relief is granted under any foreign laws);

and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 90 days (or, in the case of the 2018
Indenture, 90 consecutive days); or

(6) any other event of default provided with respect to debt securities of such series occurs.

"Bankruptcy Law" means Title 11, United States Code or any similar federal or state or foreign law for the
relief of debtors. "Custodian" means any custodian, receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator or other similar official
under any Bankruptcy Law.

<!-- PageNumber="9" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

If an event of default with respect to debt securities of any series (other than an event of default relating to
certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization of us) occurs and is continuing, the trustee by notice to us,
or the holders of, in the case of the 2013 Indenture, at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
debt securities of such series, and in the case of the 2018 Indenture, at least 33% in aggregate principal amount of
the outstanding debt securities of such series, by notice to us and the trustee, may, and the trustee at the request of
these holders will, declare the principal of and premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the debt
securities of such series to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and
unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. If an event of default relating to certain events of bankruptcy,
insolvency, or reorganization of us occurs and is continuing, the principal of and premium, if any, and accrued and
unpaid interest on the debt securities of such series will become and be immediately due and payable without any
declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holders.

The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of
any series may rescind a declaration of acceleration and its consequences, if we have deposited certain sums with
the trustee and all events of default with respect to the debt securities of such series, other than the non-payment of
the principal or interest which have become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived, as provided
in the Indentures.

An event of default for a particular series of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an event of
default for any other series of debt securities issued under the Indentures.

We are required to furnish the trustee annually within 120 days after the end of our fiscal year a statement
by one of our officers to the effect that, to the best knowledge of such officer, we are not in default in the fulfillment of
any of our obligations under the applicable Indenture or, if there has been a default in the fulfillment of any such
obligation, specifying each such default and the nature and status thereof.

No holder of any debt securities of any series will have any right to institute any judicial or other proceeding
with respect to the applicable Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy
unless:

(1) an event of default has occurred and is continuing and such holder has given the trustee prior written
notice of such continuing event of default with respect to the debt securities of such series;

(2) in the case of the 2013 Indenture, the holders of not less than 25% of the aggregate principal amount of
the outstanding debt securities of such series, and in the case of the 2018 Indenture, the holders of not
less than 33% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of such series have
requested the trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such event of default;

(3) the trustee has been offered indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against its costs, expenses and
liabilities in complying with such request;

(4) the trustee has failed to institute proceedings 60 days after the receipt of such notice, request and offer
of indemnity; and

(5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given for 60 days by the holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of such series.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities of a series will have
the right, subject to certain limitations, to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
remedy available to the trustee with respect to the debt securities of that series or exercising any trust or power
conferred to the trustee, and to waive certain defaults. Each of the Indentures provides that if an event of default
occurs and is continuing, the trustee will exercise such of its rights and powers under such Indenture, and use the
same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in
the conduct of such person's own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the trustee will be under no obligation to
exercise any of its rights or powers under the applicable Indenture at the request of any of the holders of the debt
securities of a series unless they will have offered to the trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the trustee
against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request.

<!-- PageNumber="10" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holder of any debt security will have an absolute and unconditional right
to receive payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on that debt security on or after the due dates
expressed in that debt security and to institute suit for the enforcement of payment.


### Modification and Waivers

Modification and amendments of the Indentures and the Notes may be made by us and the trustee with the
consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding series of Notes
affected thereby; provided, however, that no such modification or amendment may, without the consent of the holder
of each outstanding Note of that series affected thereby:

· change the stated maturity of the principal of, or installment of interest on, any Note;

· reduce the principal amount of any Note or reduce the amount of the principal of any Note which would
be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the maturity thereof or reduce the rate of
interest on any Note;

· reduce any premium payable on the redemption of any Note or change the date on which any Note may
or must be redeemed (in the case of the 2018 Indenture, it being understood that a change to any
notice requirement with respect to such date shall not be deemed to be a change of such date);

· change the coin or currency in which the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Note is
payable;

· impair the right of any holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or after the stated
maturity of any Note (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the redemption date);

required in order to take certain actions;

· reduce the requirements for quorum or voting by holders of Notes in the applicable Indenture or the
Note;

waiver of certain covenants by the holders of Notes except to increase any percentage vote required or
to provide that certain other provisions of the applicable Indenture cannot be modified or waived without
the consent of the holder of each Notes affected thereby;

. make any change that adversely affects the right to convert or exchange any debt security or decreases
the conversion or exchange rate or increases the conversion price of any convertible or exchangeable
debt security, unless such decrease or increase is permitted by the terms of the debt securities; or

· modify any of the above provisions.

We and the trustee may, without the consent of any holders, modify or amend the terms of the Indentures
and any series of Notes with respect to the following:

· to add to our covenants for the benefit of holders of all or any series of the Notes or to surrender any
right or power conferred upon us;

· to evidence the succession of another person to, and the assumption by the successor of our
covenants, agreements and obligations under, the applicable Indenture pursuant to the covenant
described above under the caption "Covenants-Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets";

· to add any additional events of default for the benefit of holders of all or any series of the Notes;

. to add one or more guarantees, and in the case of the 2018 Indenture, co-obligors, for the benefit of
holders of the Notes;

· to secure the Notes pursuant to the covenants of the Indenture;

<!-- PageNumber="11" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

· to add or appoint a successor or separate trustee or other agent;

· to provide for the issuance of additional debt securities of any series;

· to establish the form or terms of the debt securities of any series as permitted by the Indenture;

· to comply with the rules of any applicable securities depository;

· to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;

. in the case of the 2013 Indenture, to add to, change or eliminate any of the provisions of the 2013
Indenture in respect of one or more series of debt securities; provided that any such addition, change or
elimination (a) shall neither (1) apply to any debt security of any series created prior to the execution of
such supplemental indenture and entitled to the benefit of such provision nor (2) modify the rights of the
holder of any such debt security with respect to such provision or (b) shall become effective only when
there is no debt security described in clause (a)(1) outstanding;

. in the case of the 2018 Indenture, to add to, change or eliminate any of the provisions of the 2018
Indenture in respect of one or more series of debt securities; provided that any such addition, change or
elimination shall become effective only when there is no outstanding security of any series created prior
to the execution of such supplemental indenture that is entitled to the benefit of such provision and as to
which such supplemental indenture would apply;

· to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency;

· to change any other provision; provided that the change does not adversely affect the interests of the
holders of debt securities of, in the case of the 2013 Indenture any series, and in the case of the 2018
Indenture, any outstanding series, in any material respect;

· to supplement any of the provisions of the applicable Indenture to such extent as shall be necessary to
permit or facilitate the defeasance and discharge of any series of Notes pursuant to the Indenture;
provided that any such action shall not adversely affect the interests of the holders of Notes of such
series or any other series of debt securities in any material respect;

· to comply with the rules or regulations of any securities exchange or automated quotation system on
which any of the Notes may be listed or traded; and

· to add to, change or eliminate any of the provisions of the applicable Indenture as shall be necessary or
desirable in accordance with any amendments to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and in
the case of the 2013 Indenture, provided that such action does not adversely affect the rights or
interests of any holder of debt securities in any material respect.

The holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of any series may,
on behalf of the holders of all Notes of that series, waive compliance by us with certain restrictive provisions of the
Indentures. The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of a series
may, on behalf of the holders of all Notes of that series, waive any past default and its consequences under the
applicable Indenture with respect to the Notes of that series, except a default (1) in the payment of principal or
premium, if any, or interest on Notes of that series or (2) in respect of a covenant or provision of the applicable
Indenture that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder of each Note of that series. Upon any
such waiver, such default will cease to exist, and any event of default arising therefrom will be deemed to have been
cured, for every purpose of the Indenture; however, no such waiver will extend to any subsequent or other default or
event of default or impair any rights consequent thereon.

### Discharge, Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance

We may discharge certain obligations to holders of the Notes of a series that have not already been
delivered to the trustee for cancellation and that either have become due and payable or will become due and
payable within one year (or scheduled for redemption within one year) by depositing with the trustee, in trust, funds in
U.S. dollars in an amount sufficient to pay the entire indebtedness including, but not limited to, the principal and
premium, if any, and interest to the date of such deposit (if due and payable) or to the maturity thereof or the
redemption date of the Notes of that series, as the case may be. We may direct the trustee to invest such funds in
U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity of one year or less or in a money market fund that invests solely in short-term
U.S. Treasury securities.

The Indentures provide that we may elect either (1) to defease and be discharged from any and all
obligations with respect to the Notes of a series (except for, among other things, obligations to register the transfer or
exchange of the Notes, to replace temporary or mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes, to maintain an office or
agency with respect to the Notes and to hold moneys for payment in trust) ("legal defeasance") or (2) to be released
from our obligations to comply with the restrictive covenants under the applicable Indenture, and any omission to
comply with such obligations will not constitute a default or an event of default with respect to the Notes of a series
and clauses (3) and (6) under the caption "Events of Default" above will no longer be applied ("covenant
defeasance"). Legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, will be conditioned upon, among other
things, the irrevocable deposit by us with the trustee, in trust, of an amount in U.S. dollars, or U.S. government
obligations (as such term is modified below), or both, applicable to the Notes of that series which through the
scheduled payment of principal and interest in accordance with their terms will provide money in an amount sufficient
to pay the principal or premium, if any, and interest on the Notes on the scheduled due dates therefor.

If we effect covenant defeasance with respect to the Notes of any series, the amount in U.S. dollars, or U.S.
government obligations (as such term is modified below), or both, on deposit with the trustee will be sufficient, in the
opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent accountants, to pay amounts due on the Notes of that series at
the time of the stated maturity but may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on the Notes of that series at the time of
the acceleration resulting from such event of default. However, we would remain liable to make payment of such
amounts due at the time of acceleration.

With respect to the 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 1.375% 2029 Notes and the 2031
Notes, the term "U.S. government obligations" shall instead mean (x) any security that is (i) a direct obligation of the

German government or (ii) an obligation of a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or
instrumentality of the German government the payment of which is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the
German government or the central bank of the German government, which, in either case (x)(i) or (ii), is not callable
or redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof, and (y) certificates, depositary receipts or other instruments which
evidence a direct ownership interest in obligations described in clause (x)(i) or (x)(ii) above or in any specific principal

instead mean (x) any security that is (i) a direct obligation of the United Kingdom government or (ii) an obligation of a

We will be required to deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel that the deposit and related defeasance
will not cause the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes of that series to recognize income, gain or loss for
federal income tax purposes. If we elect legal defeasance, that opinion of counsel must be based upon a ruling from
the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or a change in law to that effect.

We may exercise our legal defeasance option notwithstanding our prior exercise of our covenant
defeasance option.

## Book-Entry and Settlement

The Notes were issued in book-entry form and are represented by global notes deposited with, or on behalf
of, a common depositary on behalf of Euroclear and Clearstream, and are registered in the name of the common
depositary or its nominee. Except as described herein, certificated notes will not be issued in exchange for beneficial
interests in the global notes.


## Certificated Notes

Subject to certain conditions, the Notes represented by the global notes are exchangeable for certificated
notes in definitive form of like tenor, in minimum denominations of €100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of
€1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 1.375% 2029 Notes and
the 2031 Notes, and in minimum denominations of £100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of £1,000 in
excess thereof in the case of the 3.050% 2029 Notes and the 2042 Notes, if:

1\. the common depositary notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary or if the
common depositary ceases to be eligible under the applicable Indenture and we do not appoint a
successor depository within 90 days;

2\. we determine that the Notes will no longer be represented by global securities and execute and deliver
to the trustee an order to that effect; or

3\. an event of default with respect to the Notes will have occurred and be continuing.

Any Note that is exchangeable as above is exchangeable for certificated notes issuable in authorized
denominations and registered in such names as the common depositary shall direct. Subject to the foregoing, a
global note is not exchangeable, except for a global note of the same aggregate denomination to be registered in the
name of the common depositary or its nominee.


## The Trustee for the Notes

The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. is the trustee under the Indentures. We have
commercial deposits and custodial arrangements with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. and its
affiliates ("BNYM"). We may enter into similar or other banking relationships with BNYM in the future in the normal
course of business. In addition, BNYM acts as trustee and as paying agent with respect to other debt securities
issued by us, and may do so for future issuances of debt securities by us as well.
